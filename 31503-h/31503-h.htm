<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The principal aim of this book is to give
the reader a good general knowledge of Russian
literature as it is to-day. The author, Serge
Persky, has subordinated purely critical material,
because he wants his readers to form their
own judgments and criticize for themselves.
The element of literary criticism is not, however,
by any means entirely lacking.</p>

<p>In the original text, there is a thorough and
exhaustive treatment of the "great prophet"
of Russian literature&mdash;Tolstoy&mdash;but the
translator has deemed it wise to omit this essay,
because so much has recently been written about
this great man.</p>

<p>As the title of the book is "Contemporary
Russian Novelists," the essay on Anton
Tchekoff, who is no longer living, does not
rightly belong here, but Tchekoff is such an
important figure in modern Russian literature
and has attracted so little attention from English
writers that it seems advisable to retain
the essay that treats of his work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, let me express my sincerest thanks
to Dr.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Maynadier of Harvard for his
kind advice; to Miss Edna Wetzler for her unfailing
and valuable help, and to Miss Carrie
Harper, who has gone over this work with painstaking
care.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br />
A BRIEF SURVEY OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE</h2>


<p>In order to get a clear idea of modern Russian
literature, a knowledge of its past is indispensable.
This knowledge will help us in
understanding that which distinguishes it from
other European literatures, not only from the
viewpoint of the art which it expresses, but also
as the historical and sociological mirror of the
nation's life in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>The dominant trait of this literature is found
in its very origins. Unlike the literatures of
other European countries, which followed, in a
more or less regular way, the development of
life and civilization during historic times, Russian
literature passed through none of these
stages. Instead of being a product of the past,
it is a protestation against it; instead of retracing
the old successive stages, it appears, intermittently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
like a light suddenly struck in the
darkness. Its whole history is a long continual
struggle against this darkness, which has gradually
melted away beneath these rays of light,
but has never entirely ceased to veil the general
trend of Russian thought.</p>

<p>As a result of the unfortunate circumstances
which characterize her history, Russia was for
a long time deprived of any relations with civilized
Europe. The necessity of concentrating all
her strength on fighting the Mongolians laid the
corner-stone of a sort of semi-Asiatic political
autocracy. Besides, the influence of the Byzantine
clergy made the nation hostile to the ideas
and science of the Occident, which were represented
as heresies incompatible with the orthodox
faith. However, when she finally threw off
the Mongolian yoke, and when she found herself
face to face with Europe, Russia was led to
enter into diplomatic relations with the various
Western powers. She then realized that European
art and science were indispensable to her,
if only to strengthen her in warfare against
these States. For this reason a number of European
ideas began to come into Russia during
the reigns of the last Muscovite sovereigns.
But they assumed a somewhat sacerdotal character
in passing through the filter of Polish
society, and took on, so to speak, a dogmatic
air. In general, European influence was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
accepted in Russia except with extreme repugnance
and restless circumspection, until the accession
of Peter I. This great monarch,
blessed with unusual intelligence and a will of
iron, decided to use all his autocratic power in
impressing, to use the words of Pushkin, "a new
direction upon the Russian vessel;"&mdash;Europe
instead of Asia.</p>

<p>Peter the Great had to contend against the
partisans of ancient tradition, the "obscurists"
and the adversaries of profane science; and this
inevitable struggle determined the first character
of Russian literature, where the satiric
element, which in essence is an attack on the
enemies of reform, predominates. In organizing
grotesque processions, clownish masquerades,
in which the long-skirted clothes and the
streaming beards of the honorable champions
of times gone by were ridiculed, Peter himself
appeared as a pitiless destroyer of the ancient
costumes and superannuated ideas.</p>

<p>The example set by the practical irony of
this man was followed, soon after the death of
the Tsar, by Kantemir, the first Russian author
who wrote satirical verses. These verses were
very much appreciated in his time. In them,
he mocks with considerable fervor the ignorant
contemners of science, who taste happiness only
in the gratification of their material appetites.</p>

<p>At the same time that the Russian authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
pursued the enemies of learning with sarcasm,
they heaped up eulogies, which bordered on
idolatry, on Peter I, and, after him, on his successors.
In these praises, which were excessively
hyperbolical, there was always some sincerity.
Peter had, in fact, in his reign, paved
the way for European civilization, and it seemed
merely to be waiting for the sovereigns, Peter's
successors, to go on with the work started by
their illustrious ancestor. The most powerful
leaders, and the first representatives of the new
literature, strode ahead, then, hand in hand, but
their paths before long diverged. Peter the
Great wanted to use European science for practical
purposes only: it was only to help the
State, to make capable generals, to win wars,
to help savants find means to develop the national
wealth by industry and commerce; he&mdash;Peter&mdash;had
no time to think of other
things. But science throws her light into the
most hidden corners, and when it brings social
and political iniquities to light, then the government
hastens to persecute that which, up to
this time, it has encouraged.</p>

<p>The protective, and later hostile, tendencies
of the government in regard to authors manifested
themselves with a special violence during
the reign of Catherine II. This erudite woman,
an admirer of Voltaire and of the French "encyclop&eacute;distes,"
was personally interested in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
writing. She wrote several plays in which she
ridiculed the coarse manners and the ignorance
of the society of her time. Under the influence
of this new impulse, which had come from one
in such a high station in life, a legion of
satirical journals flooded the country. The
talented and spiritual von Vizin wrote comedies,
the most famous of which exposes the ignorance
and cruelty of country gentlemen; in another,
he shows the ridiculousness of people who take
only the brilliant outside shell from European
civilization. Shortly, Radishchev's "Voyage
from Moscow to St.&nbsp;Petersburg" appeared.
Here the author, with the fury of passionate
resentment, and with sad bitterness, exposes the
miserable condition of the people under the
yoke of the high and mighty. It was then that
the empress, Catherine the Great, so gentle to
the world at large and so authoritative at home,
perceiving that satire no longer spared the
guardian principles necessary for the security
of the State, any more than they did popular
superstitions, manifested a strong displeasure
against it. Consequently, the satirical journals
disappeared as quickly as they had appeared.
Von Vizin, who, in his pleasing "Questions to
Catherine" had touched on various subjects
connected with court etiquette, and on the
miseries of political life, had to content himself
with silence. Radishchev was arrested, thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
into a fortress, and then sent to Siberia. They
went so far as to accuse Derzhavin, the greatest
poet of this time, the celebrated "chanter of
Catherine," in his old age, of Jacobinism for
having translated into verse one of the psalms
of David; besides this, the energetic apostle of
learning, Novikov, a journalist, a writer, and
the founder of a remarkable society which devoted
itself to the publication and circulation
of useful books, was accused of having had relations
with foreign secret societies. He was
confined in the fortress at Schluesselburg after
all his belongings had been confiscated. The
critic and the satirist had had their wings
clipped. But it was no longer possible to check
this tendency, for, by force of circumstances,
it had been planted in the very soul of every
Russian who compared the conditions of life
in his country with what European civilization
had done for the neighboring countries.</p>

<p>Excluded from journalism, this satiric tendency
took refuge in literature, where the novel
and the story trace the incidents of daily life.
Since the writers could not touch the evil at its
source, they showed its consequences for social
life. They represented with eloquence the
empty and deplorable banality of the existence
forced upon most of them. By expressing in
various ways general aspirations towards something
better, they let literature continue its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
teaching, even in times particularly hostile to
freedom of thought, like the reign of Nicholas I,
the most typical and decided adversary of the
freedom of the pen that Europe has ever seen.
Literature was, then, considered as an inevitable
evil, but one from which the world wanted to
free itself; and every man of letters seemed to
be under suspicion. During this reign, not only
criticisms of the government, but also praises
of it, were considered offensive and out of place.
Thus, the chief of the secret police, when he
found that a writer of that time, Bulgarine,
whose name was synonymous with accuser and
like evils, had taken the liberty to praise the
government for some insignificant improvements
made on a certain street, told him with severity:
"You are not asked to praise the government,
you must only praise men of letters."</p>

<p>Nothing went to print without the authorization
of the general censor, an authorization that
had to be confirmed by the various parts of the
complex machine, and, finally, by a superior
committee which censored the censors. The
latter were themselves so terrorized that they
scented subversive ideas even in cook-books, in
technical musical terms, and in punctuation
marks. It would seem that under such conditions
no kind of literature, and certainly no
satire, could exist. Nevertheless, it was at this
period that Gogol produced his best works.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
The two most important are, his comedy "The
Revizor," where he stigmatizes the abuses of
administration, and "Dead Souls," that classic
work which de Vog&uuml;&eacute; judges worthy of being
given a place in universal literature, between
"Don Quixote" and "Gil Blas," and which,
in a series of immortal types, flagellates the
moral emptiness and the mediocrity of life in
high Russian society at that time.</p>

<p>At the same time, Griboyedov's famous
comedy, "Intelligence Comes to Grief," which
the censorship forbade to be produced or even
published, was being circulated in manuscript
form. This comedy, a veritable masterpiece,
has for its hero a man named Chatsky, who was
condemned as a madman by the aristocratic
society of Moscow on account of his independent
spirit and patriotic sentiments. It is true
that in all of these works the authors hardly
attack important personages or the essential
bases of political organization. The functionaries
and proprietors of Gogol's works are
"petites gens," and the civic pathos of Chatsky
aims at certain individuals and not at the national
institutions. But these attacks, cleverly
veiling the general conditions of Russian life,
led the intelligent reader to meditate on certain
questions, and it also permitted satire to live
through the most painful periods. Later, with
the coming of the reforms of Alexander II,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
satire manifested itself more openly in the
works of Saltykov, who was not afraid to use
all his talent in scourging, with his biting sarcasm,
violence and arbitrariness.</p>

<p>Another salient trait of Russian literature is
its tendency toward realism, the germ of which
can be seen even in the most old-fashioned
works, when, following the precepts of the
West, they were taken up first with pseudo-classicism,
and then with the romantic spirit
which followed.</p>

<p>Pseudo-classicism had but few worthy representatives
in Russia, if we omit the poet Derzhavin,
whom Pushkin accused of having a poor
knowledge of his mother tongue, and whose
monotonous work shows signs of genius only
here and there.</p>

<p>As to romanticism! Here we find excellent
translations of the German poets by Zhukovsky,
and the poems of Lermontov and Pushkin, all
impregnated with the spirit of Byron. But
these two movements came quickly to an end.
Soon realism, under the influence of Dickens
and Balzac, installed itself as master of this
literature, and, in spite of the repeated efforts
of the symbolist schools, nothing has yet been
able to wipe it out. Thus, the triumph of realism
was not, as in the case of earlier tendencies,
the simple result of the spirit of imitation which
urges authors to choose models that are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
vogue, but it was a response to a powerful instinct.
The truth of this statement is very evident
in view of the fact that realism appeared
in Russian literature at a time when it was still
a novelty in Europe. The need of representing
naked reality, without any decorations, is, so
to speak, innate in the Russian author, who cannot,
for any length of time, be led away from
this practice. This is the very reason why the
Byronian influence, at the time of Pushkin and
Lermontov, lasted such a short time. After
having written several poems inspired by the
English poet, Pushkin soon disdained this
model, which was the sole object of European
imitation. "Byron's characters," he says,
"are not real people, but rather incarnations
of the various moods of the poet," and he ends
by saying that Byron is "great but monotonous."
We find the same thing in Lermontov,
who was fond of Byron, not only in a transient
mood of snobbery, but because the very strong
and sombre character of his imagination naturally
led him to choose this kind of intense
poetry. He was exerting himself to regard
reality seriously and to reproduce it with exactitude,
at the very time when he was killed in a
duel at the youthful age of twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Pushkin's best work, his novel in verse,
"Evgeny Onyegin," although it came so early,
was constructed according to realistic principles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and although we still distinguish romantic
tints, it is a striking picture of Russian society
at the beginning of the 19th century. We
find the same tendency in Lermontov's prose
novel, "A Hero of Our Times," in which the
hero, Pechorin, has many traits in common
with Evgeny Onyegin. This book immediately
made a deep impression. It was really nothing
more than a step taken in a new direction by its
author. But it was a step that promised much.
An absurd fatality destroyed this promise, and
hindered the poet, according to the expression
of an excellent critic of that time, from "rummaging
with his eagle eye, among the recesses
of the world."</p>

<p>The works of writers of secondary rank, contemporaneous
with the above mentioned, also
reveal a realistic tendency. Then appeared, to
declare it with a master's power, that genius of
a realist, of whom we have already made mention,
Gogol. There was general enthusiasm;
Gogol absorbed almost the entire attention of
the public and men of letters. The great critic
and publicist Byelinsky, in particular, took it
upon himself to elaborate in his works the theories
of realism; he formulated the program
about 1850 under the name of the "naturalistic
school." Thus the germs of the past had expanded
triumphantly in the work of Gogol, and
the way was now clear for Turgenev, Dostoyevsky,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Tolstoy, Goncharov, Ostrovsky, and
Pisemsky, who, while enlarging the range and
perfecting the methods of the naturalistic
school, conquered for their native literature the
place which it has definitely assumed in the
world.</p>

<p>Although we may infer that Russian realism
has its roots in a special spiritual predilection,
we must not nevertheless forget the historical
conditions which prepared the way for it and
made its logical development easy. Russian
literature, called on to struggle against tremendous
obstacles, could hardly have gone
astray in the domain of a nebulous idealism.</p>

<p>The third distinctive trait of this literature
is found in its democratic spirit. Most of the
heroes are not titled personages; they are
peasants, bourgeois, petty officials, students,
and, finally, "intellectuals." This democratic
taste is explained by the very constitution of
Russian society.</p>

<p>The spirit of the literature of a nation is usually
a reflection of the social class which possesses
the preponderant influence from a political
or economic standpoint or which is marked
by the strength of its numbers. The preponderance
of the upper middle class in England has
impressed on all the literature of that country
the seal of morality belonging to that class;
while in France, where aristocracy predominated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
one still feels the influence of the aristocratic
traditions which are so brilliantly manifested
in the pseudo-classic period of its literature.
But many reasons have hindered the aristocracy
and the bourgeoisie from developing
in Russia. The Russian bourgeois was,
for a long time, nothing but a peasant who had
grown rich, while the noble was distinguished
more by the number of his serfs and his authority
than by his moral superiority. Deprived
of independence, these two classes blended
and still blend with the immense number of
peasants who surround them on all sides and
submerge them irresistibly, however they may
wish to free themselves.</p>

<p>Very naturally, the first Russian authors
came from the class of proprietors, rural lords,
who were the most intelligent, not to say the
only intelligent people. In general, the life of
the lord was barely distinguishable from that of
the peasant. As he was usually reared in the
country, he passed his childhood among the village
children; the people most dear to his heart,
often more dear to him than his father or mother,
were his nurse and the other servants,&mdash;simple
people, who took care of him and gave him the
pleasures of his youthful existence. Before he
entered the local government school, he had
been impregnated with goodness and popular
poetry, drawn from stories, legends, and tales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to which he had been an ardent listener. We
find the great Pushkin dedicating his most
pathetic verses to his old nurse, and we often
see him inspired by the most humble people. In
this way, to the theoretic democracy imported
from Europe is united, in the case of the Russian
author, a treasure of ardent personal recollections;
democracy is not for him an abstract
love of the people, but a real affection, a tenderness
made up of lasting reminiscences which
he feels deeply.</p>

<p>This then was the mental state of the most
intelligent part of this Russian nobility, which
showed itself a pioneer of the ideas of progress
in literature and life. There were even singular
political manifestations produced. Rostopchin
said: "In France the shoemakers want to become
noble; while here, the nobles would like to
turn shoemakers." But, in spite of all, the
greater part of this caste, with its essential conservative
instincts, was nothing more than an
inert mass, without initiative, and incapable
even of defending its own interests except by
the aid of the government.</p>

<p>Rostopchin did not suspect the profound
truth of his capricious saying.</p>

<p>This truth burst forth in all its strength
about 1870, the time of the great reforms undertaken
by Alexander II, when the interests of
the people were, for the first time, the order of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the day. It was at this period that a great deal
of studying was being done with great enthusiasm
and that a general infatuation for folklore
and for a "union with the masses" was
being shown. The desire to become "simplified,"
that is to say to have all people live
the same kind of life, the appearance of a type,
celebrated under the sarcastic name of "noble
penitent" (meaning the titled man who is
ashamed of his privileged position as if it were
a humiliating and infamous thing), the politico-socialistic
ideology of the first Slavophiles, still
half conservative, but wholly democratic; all
these things were the results of the manifestations
which astonished Rostopchin and made the
more intelligent class of Russians fraternize
more with the masses. In our day, this tendency
has been eloquently illustrated by the greatest
Russian artist and thinker, Tolstoy, who was
the very incarnation of the ideas named above,
and who always appears to us as a highly cultured
peasant. The hero of "Resurrection"
sums up in a few words this sympathy for the
people: "This is it, the big world, the true
world!" he says, on seeing the crowd of peasants
and workingmen packed into a third-class
compartment.</p>

<p>In the last half of the 19th century, Russian
literature took a further step in the way of
democracy. It passed from the hands of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
nobility into the hands of the middle class, as
the conditions under which it existed brought it
closer to the people and made it therefore more
accessible to their aspirations. It is no longer
the great humanitarians of the privileged class
who paint the miserable conditions among which
people vegetate; it is the people themselves who
are beginning to speak of their miseries and of
their hopes for a better life. The result is a
deep penetration of the popular mind, in conjunction
with an acute, and sometimes sickly,
nervousness, which is shown in the works of the
great Uspensky, and, more recently still, in
Tchekoff, Andreyev, and many others.</p>

<p>None of these writers belong to the aristocracy,
and two of them&mdash;Tchekoff and Gorky&mdash;have
come up from the masses: the former
was the son of a serf, and the latter the son of
a workingman. Let me add that, among the
women of letters, the one who is most distinguished
by her talent in describing scenes from
popular life&mdash;Mme. Dmitrieva&mdash;is the
daughter of a peasant woman.</p>

<p>Thus, as we have shown, the Russian writers
alone, under the cover of imaginative works
which became expressive symbols, could undertake
a truly efficacious struggle against tyranny
and arbitrariness. They found themselves in
that way placed in a peculiar social position
with corresponding duties. Men expected from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
them, naturally, a new gospel and also a plan
of conduct necessary in order to escape from
the circle of oppression. The best of the Russian
writers have undertaken a difficult and
perilous task; they have become the guides, and,
so to speak, the "masters" of life. This tendency
constitutes a new trait in Russian literature,
one of its most characteristic; not that
other literatures have neglected it, but no other
literature in the world has proclaimed this mission
with such a degree of energy and with such
a spirit of sacrifice. Never, in any other country,
have novelists or poets felt with such intensity
the burden on their souls. At this point
Gogol, first of all, became the victim of this
state of things.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm stirred up by his works and
by the immense hopes that he had evoked suddenly
elevated him to such a height in the minds
of his contemporaries that he felt real anguish.
Artist he was, and now he forced himself to
become a moralist; he rushed into philosophical
speculations which led him on to a nebulous mysticism,
from which his talent suffered severely.
When he realized what had happened, despair
seized him, his ideas troubled him, and he died
in terrible intellectual distress.</p>

<p>We see also the great admirer of Gogol&mdash;Dostoyevsky&mdash;under
different pretexts making
known in almost all his novels and especially in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his magazine articles, "Recollections of an
Author," his opinions on the reforms about to
be realized. He studies the problems of civilization
which concern humanity in general, and
particularly insists upon the mission of the
Russian people, who are destined, he believes,
to end all the conflicts of the world by virtue
of a system based upon Christian love and pity.</p>

<p>Turgenev, himself, although above all an
artist, does not remain aloof from this educational
work. In his "Annals of a Sportsman,"
he attacks bondage. And when it was abolished,
and when in the very heart of Russian society,
among the younger generation, the revolutionists
appeared, Turgenev attempted to paint
these "new men." Thus in his novel, "Fathers
and Sons," he sketches in bold strokes the character
of the nihilist Bazarov. This celebrated
type cannot, however, be considered a true representative
of the mentality of the "new men,"
for it gave only a few aspects of their character,
which, besides, did not have Turgenev's
sympathy.</p>

<p>They are valued in an entirely different way
by Chernyshevsky in his novel, "What Is To
Be Done?" where the author, one of the most
powerful representatives of the great movement
toward freedom from 1860 to 1870, carefully
studied the bases of the new morals and the
means to be used in struggling against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
prejudices of the old society. Finally let us
mention Tolstoy, whose entire literary activity
was a constant search for truth, till the day
when his mind found an answer to his doubts
in the religion of love and harmony which he
preached from then on.</p>

<p>The earnestness which sees an apostle in a
writer has not ceased to grow and has almost
blinded the public.</p>

<p>For example, Gorky needed only to write
some stories in which he places before us beings
belonging to the most miserable classes of society,
to be suddenly, and perhaps against his
own will, elevated to the r&ocirc;le of prophet of a
new gospel, of annunciator from whom they
were waiting for the Word, although one could
also find the Word in the anti-socialistic circles
which he depicts. Another contemporaneous
author, Tchekoff, once wrote a story about the
precarious position of the workingman in the
city; he showed how this man, after he had become
old and had gone back to his native village,
suffered even more misery than before instead
of getting the rest he had hoped for. Immediately
an ardent controversy took place between
the two factions of the youth of that time,
the Populists and the Marxists. The former,
defending the rural population, accused the
author of having exaggerated and of having
only superficially considered the question, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the others triumphed, confident in the activity
of the people of the city.</p>

<p>The literary critic, however, in carefully
studying the works of these authors, tried to
get at the real meaning,&mdash;the idea between the
lines. Gorky's philosophy has often been discussed;
a great many men of letters have tried
to unravel what there was of pessimism, of indifference
or of mystic idealism in the soul of
Tchekoff. This everlasting habit, not to say
this mania, of analyzing the mind or soul of an
author in order to get at his conception, his
personal doctrine of life, often leads to partial
and erroneous conclusions, especially when, as
in most cases, the critic has only a very vague
idea of the main current of thought which
formed the genesis of the work.</p>

<p>The hopes and emotions which are aroused by
every original expression in literature, show
more than ever what hopes are based upon its
r&ocirc;le, the mission which has devolved on it to
serve life, by formulating the facts of the ideal
to be realized.</p>

<p>But what is this ideal? What are these ideal
aspirations? Of what elements are they made
up? What is the state of mind of the great
majority of Russian "intellectuals" in the
midst of the enmity which compromises and
menaces them?</p>

<p>Thanks to the window pierced by Peter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Great in the thick Muscovite wall, the Russian
"intellectuals" have begun to have a general
idea of European civilization. They have admired
the beauty of this culture, and the greatness
of European political and social institutions,
guarantees of the dignity of human beings;
they have endured mental suffering because
they have found that in Russia such
independence would be impossible, and, consequently,
they have had a feeling of extreme bitterness,
which has forced them either to deny or
calumniate the moral forces of their country, or
to formulate very strange theories about this situation.
Thus at the end of the first twenty-five
years of the century, Chadayev, one of the most
original and brilliant thinkers of Russia, developed
the following thesis in his "Philosophical
Letters":&mdash;the fatal course of history having
opposed the union of the Russian people with
Catholicism, through which European civilization
developed, Russia found herself reduced
forever to the existence of an inert mass, deprived
of all interior energy, as can be shown
adequately by her history, her customs, and
even the aspect of her national type with its
ill-defined traits and apathetic expression.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the course of the terrible struggle which
he waged against the censorship and against
influential persons evilly disposed toward him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Pushkin cried out: "It was the idea of the
devil himself that made me be born in Russia!"
And in one of his letters, he says, "Naturally,
I despise my country from east to west, but,
nevertheless, I hate to hear a stranger speak
of it with scorn." Lermontov, exiled to the
Caucasus, ironically takes leave of his country,
which he calls, "a squalid country of slaves and
masters." And he salutes the Caucasian mountains
as the immense screen which may hide him
from the eyes of the Russian pachas. The
Slavophiles themselves, the patriots who in their
way idealized both Russian orthodoxy and autocracy,
and who were wrongly considered the
champions of the existing order of things,
showed themselves no less hostile. One of their
most celebrated representatives, Khomyakov,
sees in Russia "a land stigmatized" by serfdom,
where all is injustice, lies, morbid laziness
and turpitude.</p>

<p>Dostoyevsky, who shared some of the illusions
of the Slavophiles, speaks of Europe as
"a land of sacred miracles." Nevertheless,
yielding to his desire to heighten the prestige
of his country, he adds: "The Russian is not
partially European, but essentially so, in the
very largest sense of the word, because he
watches, with an impartial love, the progress
achieved by the various peoples of Europe,
while each one of <i>them</i> appreciates, above all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the progress of his own country, and often does
not want to let the others share it."</p>

<p>In spite of the seductive powers which European
civilization exercised upon Russia, the
Russians perceived its weak sides, which they
studied by the light of the ideal which they
promised themselves to attain in some indefinite
future, a future which they nevertheless hoped
was near at hand.</p>

<p>To them, enthusiastic observers that they
were, these defects became more apparent than
to the Europeans themselves; as their critical
sense was not deadened by the wear of constant
use, they saw in a clear light the inconveniences
of certain institutions, they perceived the sad
consequences of the excessive triumph of individualism
in its struggle for life, the enfranchisement
of the proletariat, the satisfaction
of the few at the cost of the many. At
times the bases of this civilization seemed fragile
to the Russians; they had a feeling that it was
not finished; they also aspired more and more
to the harmonious equilibrium of society which
appealed to their ideal.</p>

<p>In a word, that which has always been called
socialism, has had an irresistible attraction for
the more intelligent Russians; all of Russian
literature is permeated with it, and it has developed
all the more easily because it found a
favorable basis in Russia's natural democracy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>During the period when this literature was
most persecuted&mdash;that is to say in the second
half of the 19th century&mdash;its most influential
representatives were ardent socialists. Among
them should be mentioned the critic Byelinsky,
the "Petracheviens,"&mdash;adepts in the doctrine
of Fourier,&mdash;and that powerful agitator of
ideas, Hertzen, who founded the Russian free
press in London. Among Western writers,
there were two well liked in Russia: George
Sand and Charles Dickens. The former was a
socialist, the latter was a democrat. Their influence
was very great in Russia; their works
were read with ardor, and gave rise to thoughts
which escaped the severities of the censor, but
betrayed themselves in private conversation, as
well as in certain literary circles.</p>

<p>All the celebrated writers of Europe who
professed liberal tendencies met with a greater
sympathy among the Russians of that time than
in their own country. Dickens, received with
great enthusiasm in Russia, was not appreciated
by the English public. His excellent translator,
Vedensky, tried hard to persuade him to come
to Russia to live, where his talents would be
valued at their true worth. We can then readily
understand how Dostoyevsky, in his "Memoirs
of an Author," had the right to say that
the European socialistic-democrats had two
countries, first their own, then Russia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian writers who gave themselves up
so passionately to this influence,&mdash;still so new
even in Europe,&mdash;not able to support their
political ideal, with a press, as it were, gagged
by the censor, engaged in the struggle along the
line of customs. They attacked the prejudices
which clog the relations among men, and rose
up against family despotism and the inferior
position of women from a civil and economic
point of view. But, between 1860 and 1870,
when the enfranchisement of the serfs reduced
the power of the censor, all that had been confined
in the souls of the Russians burst forth.
Chernishevsky wrote economic articles on capital
and on the agricultural community; he studied
the system of John Stuart Mill, from which he
deduced his socialistic conclusions, and his reputation
grew immediately at home and abroad.
He became a leader of thought among the new
generation.</p>

<p>At the same time, the young critic Dobrolyubov,
author of an analytical study of Russian
customs, "The Kingdom of Shadows," called
the "intellectuals" to a struggle for the rights
of the oppressed people, and was ready himself
to "drain the bitter cup intended for those who
have been sacrificed." Also at this time there
appeared the poet Nekrasov and the satirist
Saltykov. The former, a profound pessimist,
described in his best verses the bitter fate of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
lower classes; the latter with his sarcasm
scathed bureaucratic arbitrariness, while from
abroad was heard the free ringing of "The
Bell,"&mdash;a paper founded by Hertzen,&mdash;which
seemed to be announcing that freedom was coming.
Two articles by the poet Mikhailov on
the situation of women started a vast movement.
The women soon filled the lecture-halls of the
university, and the class-rooms, and organized
a veritable campaign to defend their rights in
the name of the principle of liberty. All the
partisans of democracy or socialism applauded
them. The agitation became general; it seemed
as if they wanted to make up for lost time by
this tremendous activity; everywhere Sunday
schools were started and public libraries opened;
workingmen's associations were formed on socialistic
principles, and the ardent younger generation
spoke to the ignorant masses and asked
them to join them in the coming struggle.</p>

<p>This epoch has been called "the moral springtime"
of Russia, and in truth it was a spring
with all of its real splendors and illusions. A
sudden wave of life surged from one end of the
empire to the other. Up above, the government
was making reforms prudently, as if afraid
of going too far; down below, a great transformation
was taking place. It was at this time
that certain bold projects were contemplated
at which the government took fright. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
"springtime" proved ephemeral. A triumphant
reaction nipped in the bud this movement
towards emancipation, with all its hopes. In
1877, after the Russo-Turkish war, it seemed as
if the movement were going to start again.
Less vast and less diverse, but more definite, it
immediately put all of its strength into the
popular propaganda and showed its activity by
the assassination of the emperor and by several
other crimes. It was a terrible struggle, till
finally the leaders again succumbed under the
mighty blows of their adversaries. The years
that followed this defeat (1880-1905) were most
inauspicious in Russian life. A profound
apathy deadened society, and an atmosphere
of anguish and disillusion&mdash;which have left
visible traces in Russian literature&mdash;weighed
it down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In short, it may be said that Russian thought
has always been led away by the theories of
certain European parties who are most opposed
to political and social organization of the state.</p>

<p>The vigor, the clearness, and the force of
negation with which this characteristic manifests
itself in the ideas and customs of the Russian
radical-socialists have often distorted, in the
eyes of other countries, opinions or doctrines
which it is important to present in their true
light.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, Bazarov, that nihilistic creation of
Turgenev, appeared to the English, French,
and German public as a mystical hero not viable
in human society, while Pisarev, one of the
sanest of Russian critics, considers him as a
model of the really free man. As to Turgenev
himself, he saw that the coming of this type
would make concrete a rising force worthy of
holding attention and also of commanding some
respect.</p>

<p>In practical life, this negative force has found
its most extreme expression in what has already
been pointed out, that is, in the revolutionary
anarchism of Bakunin and in Tolstoy's recent
theories of pacific anarchism, which are founded
on the gospel. But, while very significant as
great illustrations of certain sides of Russian
mentality, neither the one nor the other of these
anarchistic doctrines, so opposed in their substance,
can be considered as an expression of the
modern Russian socialistic movement. Having
found a basis in the workingman movement of
their country, the Russian socialistic theoreticians
have become more practical, and their activity
turns back to the realm of European
socialism, which is to be found in the doctrines
of Karl Marx.</p>

<p>There was a time in Europe when they christened
with the name "nihilism" this active negation
of civilization and of bourgeois customs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
so characteristic of the Russian "intellectuals."
Taken in its literal sense, this word
is inexact, since those to whom it was applied
were inspired by a very high ideal. In a loose
use of the word, nihilism has, on the contrary,
a real significance, especially if one connects it
with most of the Russian "intellectuals." The
liberal tendencies which were brewing in the
realistic literature of the period from 1840 to
1850, and which manifested themselves suddenly
with particular strength during the tumultuous
decade between 1860 and 1870, made the substance
of the new theories and the base of Russian
mentality. These theories were very bold
in their negation, and it is for this reason that
they have been called "nihilistic."</p>

<p>If this intellectual "&eacute;lite" should some day
triumph in Russia, will it be true to its moral
idea of justice and liberty? It probably will.
We may then see the following phenomenon take
place: the realization of the most advanced program
of modern civilization in one of the most
backward countries of Europe.</p>

<p>However paradoxical such a prevision may
seem at first, it has a fundamental element of
truth. Two obstacles bar the way to civilization
and the normal development of new ideas, which
are the foundation of progress. First of all,
there is the na&iuml;ve and boorish ignorance of the
common people; then the resistance which every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
established society instinctively offers to ideas
of reformation. Of these two conservative
forces, Russia knows but one, pure and simple
ignorance, while the second, which can have art
and science as powerful allies, is completely lacking.
But ignorance cannot last forever. It
diminishes more and more; that is why the most
advanced ideas of European civilization naturally
go hand in hand with learning in Russia,
and occupy all places which knowledge wins
from ignorance. Since the Russian has had a
taste of science he has become the champion of
social and democratic ideas; the latter develop
even with elementary instruction, as can easily
be seen by observing the movements made among
the workmen of the city, and also among the
more advanced elements of the peasant population.</p>

<p>These particulars had already attracted the
attention of the brilliant peace advocate and
profound thinker, Hertzen, who, distressed by
the bloody reprisals of bourgeoise Europe,
following the Revolution of 1848, fixed his attention
on Russia, from which he expected great
things,&mdash;among others, a new civilization freed
from the prejudices and customs which held it
back in other countries.</p>

<p>Hertzen represented Russia as an immense
plain where people were getting rid of old
thatched cottages, and at the same time collecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the necessary materials for new habitations.
He saw a world in which no one lived as yet, but
where life as it should be was being prepared for.
And this idea, which may seem exaggerated, has
a good deal of sense in it. Does not every backward
nation, which hastens to take her place in
the circle of the more advanced peoples of Europe,
resemble a vessel into which a new wine is
to be poured?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If modern Russian literature has not deviated
from its fundamental principles, realism, democracy,
and socialism, on the other hand, a radical
change has taken place in society which has
necessarily had an influence on it. The populace
is not the sombre, inert, and ignorant multitude
that it has been heretofore. Learning is
penetrating more and more; and as an advance-guard,
it has the workingmen of the city and
the people of the suburbs. A feeling of dignity,
of human personality, and a love of liberty is
awakening in the masses who have joined in the
struggle which the "intellectuals" are conducting
against the passive forces of autocracy.</p>

<p>That is why the literature of this time&mdash;always
excepting the period from 1905 to 1910&mdash;is
pre&euml;minently a literature of fiercer and
more active combat than ever before. As in
times gone by, the heroes of this literature are
common people. The writers choose them from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
among the students, schoolmasters, and school-mistresses
of the village schools, who with complete
disregard of self carry on the great work
of popular education in the very heart of the
country, without caring about the arbitrary
power which menaces them, or the moral and
material conditions of their lives. They also
choose them from among the doctors of the districts
who are worn out in despairing efforts to
struggle against the terrible epidemics, and who
are also trying to improve hygienic conditions
among the peasants. In fine, among the heroes
are included all who sacrifice their personal interests
for the general good.</p>

<p>The results of this terrible struggle against
brute force are shown in the excessive nervousness
of the combatants, who have become delirious
with their aspirations towards liberty.
Hatred of actual reality and distrust of those
who have resigned themselves to it have made
them accept sympathetically the most extreme
and uncompromising measures, and one often
thinks one sees a certain generosity among the
people who are at war with society,&mdash;often, it
is true, for egotistical reasons, far removed from
the great ideal of reforms profitable to the
masses. Such are the celebrated barefoot
brigade, the eternal vagabonds, the "lumpen-proletariat"
of Gorky's early works.</p>

<p>Another favorite subject of the Russian authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
is the antagonism which makes parents
and children quarrel. But the children who were
radicals of the former generation have now became
fathers, and are often reproached by their
sons for the practical impossibility of the ideal
for which they vainly expended their strength,
and, as a result of which, they are worn out and
useless. Veressayev and Chirikov have written
most on this point.</p>

<p>However, in spite of repeated attacks, the resistance
has grown in intensity and the general
uneasiness has spread without any one's being
able as yet to see any lasting or positive result.
The pessimism of various writers faithfully reflects
this crisis. Andreyev, for instance, possesses
an extraordinary intuition of the element
of tragic mysteriousness which envelops the
slightest circumstances of daily life. Tchekoff,
the prominent author who died a few years ago,
has left us remarkably realistic sketches, where
he obviously shows mental discouragement as a
result of the struggle. Another contemporary
writer, Korolenko, whose poetic talent recalls
Turgenev to our minds, is distinguished, on the
contrary, by the attempts he has made to set
free the spark of life which exists in human beings
who have broken down morally. All these
writers have such a direct and powerful influence
on contemporary youth that we are going to
study them separately in this book, not excepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Tchekoff, whose influence is still enormous.</p>

<p>Since the death of the prophet of Yasnaya-Polyana,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Russian literature cannot boast of
any writers who compare with Turgenev, Dostoyevsky,
Goncharov, or the dramatist Ostrovsky.
The cause is to be traced rather to circumstances
than to the authors themselves. For
social life to furnish material suitable for the
artist's description, it must first of all have
types which show a certain consistency, a more
or less determined attitude. But it is futile to
look for either stability or precision in Russian
life since Russia has been going through continual
crises. It would be just as difficult for
literature to record rapid changes of ideas, as
for an artist to copy a model that cannot pose
for him. Besides, most contemporary writers
are struggling hard for the means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Sometimes their effort to get food has so
sapped their strength that they have not had
enough time to finish their studies, nor enough
tranquillity of soul to apply their talents to an
impartial view of life and to incorporating in
their work the documents which they have collected.
Even in the writing of the best Russian
authors of to-day one often feels that there is
something unfinished, or hasty, as if their
thoughts had not matured.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not think that it will be superfluous to
add that all Russian literature for the past
century has been able to express only a very
small part of what it had to say. The Russian
writer continually suffers from the constraint
which forces him to check the flight of his inspiration
in order to escape from the foolish
and often stupid sternness of the pitiless censor.
The poet Nekrasov shows us in one of his poems
an old soldier who has become a printer, and
who speaks in the following manner of Pushkin:</p>

<p>"He was a good man, tipped very generously,
but he never ceased to rage against the
censor. When he saw his manuscripts marked
with red crosses, he became furious. One day,
in order to console him, I said:</p>

<p>"'Bah! why torment yourself?'</p>

<p>"'Why,' he cried, 'but it is blood that is
flowing,&mdash;blood,&mdash;my blood!'"</p>

<p>A great deal of blood was thus shed. And in
order to accentuate the action of the censor the
police dealt cruel blows to the authors. One
day Pushkin was called to the head of the department.
They believed that they had recognized
in one of his satires a certain gentleman,
named N.&nbsp;G., who demanded that Pushkin be
severely punished. Unnerved by the cross-examination
to which he was put, the poet cried:</p>

<p>"But it isn't N.&nbsp;G. whom I have drawn!"</p>

<p>"Who is it, then?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is you, yourself," replied the poet.</p>

<p>"That is madness, sir," the high dignitary
cried out with wrath. "You say that wood belonging
to the state was stolen. And at the
time when these thefts were committed I was
away."</p>

<p>"Then you do not recognize yourself in my
satire?"</p>

<p>"No, a thousand times no!"</p>

<p>"And N.&nbsp;G. recognizes himself?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but as he is in the service of
the government...."</p>

<p>"Well, is he its spokesman and champion?
And why is it precisely he who asks to have me
arrested?"</p>

<p>"All right," replied the dignitary, suddenly
becoming milder, "I shall inform His Majesty
of our conversation."</p>

<p>The affair ended without further complications.
It should be noted that the Tsar himself
protected Pushkin, for Pushkin had got into
touch with him in order to influence him more
successfully. Nevertheless, this acquaintance
was only a new source of suffering to the poet.
In the case of certain less known writers the
malevolence of the higher authorities often took
on a tragic turn. For a single poem in which
the poet Polezhayev described a students' debauch,
the author was reduced by Nicholas I to
the rank of a common soldier. Sokolovsky, another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
writer of this time, not being able to get
a footing in literature, abandoned the pen, and
like many others, sought to forget his disappointment
in drink. For several years Hertzen
was transferred from one place of exile to another
until he came to England. And how terrible
was the fate of the talented poet of Little
Russia, Shevchenko, who was exiled for many
years to a corner of European Russia and forbidden
to do any writing or even painting, a
thing that he loved above all! And finally, who
does not know the sad comedy of Dostoyevsky,
who was made to go through all the preparations
for his execution, but was finally sent to
that prison which he has so wonderfully described
in his recollections of "The Dead
House"?</p>

<p>The Damocles' sword of defiant authority was
suspended over the head of every Russian writer.
The vocation of literature was filled with danger
and brought about actual tragedies in some
families. Thus, Pushkin's father, fearing that
the fury of the authorities would extend to him,
began to hate all literature, and had serious
quarrels with his son. Griboyedov's mother
threw herself at her son's feet and begged him
not to write any more but rather to enter the
service of the State. In Griboyedov we have a
sad example of a great talent virtually buried
alive by the censor. His comedy, "Intelligence

Comes to Grief," is a masterful work, sparkling
with satiric warmth, the equal of which it would
be hard to find anywhere. This first work, rich
in promise, was never published nor produced.
Discouraged, the author renounced literature,
and on the advice of his mother, accepted a position
as ambassador to Persia, where he was
killed in a riot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not only does the censorship mutilate literary
works, but it often suffocates the inspiration
of the author. The Russian press has lately
published a very interesting article on Nekrasov,
explaining the frequent interruptions of his
activity by a momentary paralysis of his inspiration.
Often, he writes, the ideas and
poetic forms which come to his mind are so
strong that he need only take up his pen and
write them down. But the thought that what
he might write would be condemned by the
censor, stops him. It was, then, a long struggle
between the ideas which he wanted to express
and the obstacles which hindered him. And
when finally Nekrasov had smothered his inspiration,
he was broken down and crushed by
fatigue and disgust, and for a long time he
stopped writing. His friends advised him to
jot down his ideas in spite of all, in the hope
that they would be recognized by future generations
when happier days should dawn on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
literature. He was not successful, because in
order to create his genius needed to feel a close
bond between him and his readers. Thus the
censor carried his brutal hand into the very
laboratory of thought.</p>

<p>Happily, since the movement toward reform
between 1860 and 1870, the Russian censor
has become more lenient and now no one says
what was once said to the writer Bulgarin:
"Your business is to describe public activities,
popular holidays, the theatre. Do not look for
other topics." The number of subjects open to
the press has increased. But the desire to live
a free life has developed in literature and in
society alike, and as resistance to it has also
strengthened, the pressure has remained relatively
the same. The censor and the police continue
to stifle the natural richness and the power
of the Russian mind. To-day, as before, Russian
literature is made up of just that small
fraction of the whole which has escaped government
inquisition.</p>

<p>However, in spite of all the unheard-of constraints
which weigh upon her, Russia has already
given us such great authors, that we
need not hesitate to say that on the day when
she regains liberty of speech and of pen, her
literature will take its place among the first in
the world.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br />
ANTON TCHEKOFF<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h2>


<p>"There is a saying that man needs only
six feet of ground, but that is for a corpse and
not for a living man. It is not six feet of
ground that man requires, not even an entire
estate, but the whole terrestrial globe, nature
in its fullness, so that all his faculties can expand
freely."</p>

<p>This is the proud profession of faith that
Anton Tchekoff made on entering the literary
world. He was born January 17, 1860, at
Taganrog, where his father, a freed serf, lived.
After attending school in his native town, he
took up the study of medicine at Moscow.
Once a doctor, rather than practise, he devoted
most of his time to literature. His career as
an author does not offer us any extraordinary
situations. He owed his success, and later on
his glory, to severe and prolonged work. His
literary talent manifested itself while he was
still a student. He began his career with
humorous short stories which were published
in various newspapers. They brought him
enough for the bare necessities of life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>These stories have been collected in two
volumes. They are very short, almost miniatures.
For the most part they are elegant
trifles, worked out with painstaking care. One
feels that the author had no definite goal in
sight; he wrote them simply to amuse and
entertain his readers. One would search in
vain for any sort of philosophy. On the contrary,
one finds there a rather significant spirit,
a gaiety, care-free, loquacious and, at times,
ironical. Unimportant people tell pleasant
things about themselves or others. All these
men are a trifle debauched, talky, futile, and
their companions are flighty, intriguing little
women who chatter incessantly. Everything
begins and ends with a laugh. This recalls
some of the early works of Gogol, but, we
repeat, one finds no moral element in this
laughter, and these tiny comedies are in reality
no more than simple vaudeville sketches. Once
in a while we find a sad note; less frequently,
we find the sadness accentuated in order to present
a terrible drama. Such, then, are the contents
of the first two volumes which came from
the pen of Tchekoff.</p>

<p>However, this melancholy little note, met
from time to time, gradually grew in intensity
in the third volume, until later on it lost all
trace of the old carelessness, and developed, on
the contrary, into a profound sadness. Tchekoff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
unconsciously gave up the "genre" of
pleasant anecdote in order to concentrate all
his attention on facts. This practice made him
sad. Russia was, at this time, going through
a period of prostration as a result of the last
Russo-Turkish war. This war, which, at the
cost of enormous sacrifices, ended in the liberation
of the Bulgarian people, awakened among
the Russians a hope of obtaining their own
liberty, and provoked among the younger generation
the most energetic efforts to obtain this
liberty, no matter what the cost might be.
Alas, this hope was frustrated! All efforts
were in vain, a reaction followed, and the year
1880 brought the reaction to its height.
From then on apathy followed in the steps
of the great enthusiasm. All illusion fled. A
kind of disenchantment filled all minds.
Those who had hoped with such ardor, and
had counted on their own strength, felt weak
and powerless. Some confined themselves to
moaning incessantly. A grey twilight enveloped
Russian life and filled it with melancholy.
These are the dreary aspects that Tchekoff
describes, and none has excelled him in portraying
the events of this hopeless reaction.
His stories and dramas give us a long procession
of people who succumb to the monotony,
to the platitudes, to the desolation, of existence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is in the following manner that one of his
characters expresses his ideas on the subject of
this moral crisis:</p>

<p>"I was then not more than twenty-six years
of age; nevertheless I was conscious not only
that life was senseless, but that it was without
any visible goal; that all was illusion and
dupery; that, in its consequences and even in
its very essence, the life of the exiled on the
island of Sakhaline was very much the same as
the life that was led at Nice; that the difference
between the brain of Kant and the brain
of a fly was very small; finally, that no one in
this world was either right or wrong."</p>

<p>This idea of the nothingness of life, with its
extremes, monstrous and profitless, is often
found in the work of Tchekoff. His story
"The Kiss" is but a variation of this theme,&mdash;the
absurdity of life. Lieutenant Riabovich,
under the influence of a chance kiss, a kiss that
was not meant for him, dreams of love for an
entire summer; he waits impatiently for the
return of the pretty stranger; but alas, his
lovely dream cannot be realized, for the simple
and cruel reason that no one is waiting for
<i>him</i>, no one is interested in him. One day, on
the banks of a stream, the young officer gives
himself up to his reflections:</p>

<p>"The water flows off; one knows not where
nor why; it flowed in exactly the same way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
last May; from the stream it flows into the
river, and then into the sea; then it evaporates,
turns into rain, and perhaps the very same
water again flows by before my eyes.... To
what good? Why?" And all life appears to
Riabovich an absurd mystification and seems
thoroughly senseless.</p>

<p>The hero of "The Bet" absolutely scorns
humanity, with its petty and its great deeds,
its little and its great ideas, because he feels
that after all everything must disappear, be
annihilated, and the earth itself will turn into
a mass of ice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tchekoff has given us innumerable rough
sketches typical of people belonging to the
most diverse social classes. He seems to take
his readers by the hand and to lead them
wherever he can show them characteristic scenes
of modern Russian society,&mdash;be it in the country,
in the factory, in princely dwellings, at the
post-office, or on the highway. He barely takes
the time absolutely necessary to depict in a
few, appropriate words a state of mind or the
secret of a gesture. One would say that he
hastens to express the totality of life with the
variety of his detached manifestations of it.
That is why his stories are short; often mere
allusions stand in place of actual development.
And whatever domains or corners of Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
life the reader, under the guiding hand of this
perspicacious cicerone, may visit, he will almost
always go away with one predominating impression:
the lamentable isolation of Russia.</p>

<p>"The Windswept Grain" shows the reader
a religious establishment, where a young Jew,
recently converted, has taken refuge. Here is
a young man, very impressionable and eager
to learn, who has fled from his home and his
family, whose prejudices offended him. His
family tries every means to bring him back
and to punish his apostasy.</p>

<p>In order to employ his energies effectively,
the young proselyte, who has embraced the new
religion only that he may follow progress,
tries to get a position as a school-teacher. But
the apostleship of learning cannot satisfy his
versatile mind: he continues to flit from one
thing to another, like a gypsophilia, driven by
the wind across the entire stretch of the steppes
of southern Russia.</p>

<p>Then Tchekoff takes us to a postal station
to show us another type of the "Windswept
Grain." This man, like the young convert, is
a dreamer, who puts heart and soul into any
new idea that comes along. He also has spent
his life in searching for an activity corresponding
to his ideal. At present, being a
widower, he is obliged to support both himself
and his daughter, who, while loving him devotedly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
never ceases to reproach him for the
many inconveniences of their uncertain existence.
In the evening, a young widow from a
neighboring province gets off at the place
where he and his daughter are living. When
she sees the young girl pouting, she consoles
her by caressing her with the tact peculiar to
women. Then, at tea time, she starts talking
to the father. The idealist tells of his life, and
reveals to the young woman the plans that he
has made. The true sympathy with which she
listens, and the respectful and tender feeling
that he has for her, inevitably makes the reader
think that fate has not brought these two
people together in vain, and that their lives
will be united. This impression persists when
on the next day we find the young woman entering
her carriage assisted by her companion
of the evening before. We wait for the word
that will unite this couple. But neither of
them pronounces the all-important phrase.
The carriage leaves; the man remains for a
long time motionless as a statue, watching with
a mingled feeling of joy and suffering the
distant road and his disappearing happiness,
which, but a moment ago, he seemed to hold in
his hand.</p>

<p>After those who insist on always realizing
their temporary ideals, let us take up characters
of a new type, those whom destiny has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
irredeemably conquered, and who have finally
resigned themselves to their fate.</p>

<p>An example of this type is Sofia Lvovna in
"Volodia the Great and Volodia the Small."
Married to a rich colonel, she has no other end
in life. The days pass, tiresome, monotonous,
filled only with visits and driving; the nights
are interminable and sad near this husband whom
she does not love, and whom she married out of
spite and for money. Love for a comrade of
her youth, Volodia by name, fills her heart.
But this young man, who has recently finished
his studies, is just as commonplace and just as
debauched as her husband and the society which
surrounds her. Sofia Lvovna is not yet resigned
to her fate. She speaks of her aspirations
to her childhood friend, who, after getting
from her what he desires, leaves her at the end
of a week. And Sofia Lvovna becomes frightened
at the thought that for the young girls
and women of her station there is no other
alternative than to go on riding in carriages,
or to enter a convent and gain salvation.</p>

<p>"The Attack" gives us an example of the
terrible feeling of terror that suddenly enters
the proud soul of a young man at his first contact
with certain realities.</p>

<p>The student Vassiliev, a young man of excessively
nervous temperament, has visited a
house of ill-fame, and since then, he cannot rid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
himself of his painful impressions. Sombre
thoughts beset his mind: "Women, living
women!" he repeats, his head between his hands.
"If I broke this lamp you would say that it
was too bad; but down there it is not lamps
that they break, it is the existence of human
creatures! Living women!..."</p>

<p>He dreams of several ways of saving these
unfortunates, and he decides childishly to
stand on a street-corner, and say to each
passer-by:</p>

<p>"Where are you going? and why? Fear
God."</p>

<p>But this desire soon gives place to a general
state of anguish and hatred of himself. The
evil seems too great for him, and its vastness
crushes him. In the meantime, the people
about him do not suffer; they are indifferent
or incredulous. The student feels that he is
losing his mind. They confine him. Later on,
when, cured, he leaves the alienist, "he blushes
at his anxiety."... The general indifference
has broken down his aspirations, smothered his
vague dream.</p>

<p>In "Peter the Bishop," we see a man, good
and simple, the son of peasants. This man,
thanks to his intelligence, has raised himself
to the rank of bishop. During all his life he
has suffocated in this high ecclesiastical position,
the pompous tinsel of which troubles him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to such an extent that the cordial and sincere
relationship existing between him and his old
mother, who is so full of respect for her son,
is broken off. After his death he is quickly forgotten.
The old mother, now childless, when
she walks in the fields with the women of the
village, still speaks of her children, of her
grandchildren, and of her son, the bishop.
But she speaks timidly of him, as if she feared
that they would not believe her. And, in
truth, no one puts any faith in what she
says.</p>

<p>It is among the people and the working
classes that man is most completely rid of all
traces of an artificial and untruthful exterior;
the struggle against misery does not leave
much room for other preoccupations; life is
merciless, it crushes unrelentingly man's dreams
of happiness, and often does not leave any one
to share the burden of sorrows or even its simple
cares. The short and very touching story
of "The Coachman" gives us an excellent
example of this loneliness. Yona, a poor coachman,
has lost his son; he feels that he has not
the strength to live through this sorrow alone;
he feels the absolute need of speaking to some
one. But he tries in vain to confide his sorrows
to one or the other of his patrons. No
one listens to him. Therefore, once his day's
work is over, alone in the stable, he pours out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
his heart to his horse: "Yes, my little mare, he
is dead, my beloved child.... Let us suppose
that you had a colt, and that this colt should
suddenly die, wouldn't that cause you sorrow?"
The mare looks at him with shining eyes, and
snuffles the hand of her master, who ends by
telling her the entire story of the sickness and
death of his son.</p>

<p>In "The Dreams," a miserable vagabond,
whom two constables are taking to the neighboring
city, dreams aloud of the pleasant life
he expects to lead in Siberia, whither he hopes
to be deported. His gaolers listen to him not
without a certain interest. They also begin to
dream ... they dream of a free country, from
which they are separated by an enormous
stretch of land, a country that they can hardly
conceive. One of them brusquely interrupts
the dreams of the vagabond: "That's all right,
brother, you'll never get to that enchanted
land. How are you going to get there? You
are going to travel 300 versts and then you'll
give your soul up to God. You are already
almost gone." And then, in the imagination
of the vagabond, other scenes present themselves:
the slowness of justice, the temporary
jails, the prison, the forced marches and the
weary halts, the hard winters, sickness, the
death of comrades.... "A shudder passes
through his whole body, his head trembles and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
his body contracts like a worm which has been
trodden upon...."</p>

<p>Let us now look at those numerous stories of
Tchekoff which treat of peasant life: "The
Peasants," "The Murder," "In the Ravine,"
and others.</p>

<p>"The Peasants" is one of the most important
of the stories which treat of the country,
and was recently conspicuous for bringing up
the question, violently discussed by the Marxists
and the Populists, of the life of the people
in the city and in the country.</p>

<p>Nicholas Chigueldyev, a waiter in a Moscow
hotel, falls sick and has to leave his work. All
his savings go into the hands of the doctor and
the druggist. As he does not seem to improve,
he decides to return to his native village, where
his family is still living. If the air of the
country does not cure him, he will at least die
at home. He had left the village at an early
age, and had never gone back to visit. He
goes home with his wife and his little daughter.
There he finds his mother, his father, and his
two brothers and their wives in the most abject
misery. The whole family is entombed in a
dark and filthy "isba" full of flies. Nicholas
and his wife immediately see that it would have
been better for them to have remained in Moscow.
But it is too late. They haven't enough
money to return; they must remain. A horrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
life begins for the sick man and his family.
There are endless quarrels, blows, abuses.
They reproach one another for eating and even
for living. They are angry at Nicholas and
his wife for having come. The latter is soon
tired of this existence. In the city Nicholas
had broken himself of country manners. He
wants to go back to Moscow. But where find
the money for the trip?... His sickness becomes
more acute. An old tailor, a former
nurse, who has been called in, promises to cure
him; he bleeds him several times and Nicholas
dies. The widow and her little daughter spend
the winter in the village. The young woman,
who had watched during those long days of
suffering, is now broken down. When spring
comes, the mother and daughter go to the
church, and, after praying at the grave of
their dead, they go begging on the highway.</p>

<p>In "The Murder" Tchekoff studies certain
manifestations in the spiritual life of the
peasants. Matvey Terekof belongs to a peasant
family the members of which are all
known for their piety; in the village they are
called "the singing boys." Very orthodox,
they hold themselves aloof and give themselves
over to mysticism.</p>

<p>Instead of playing with his little comrades,
Matvey is constantly poring over the Gospel.
His piety increases, he prays night and day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
hardly eats anything, and experiences "a singular
joy at feeling himself grow weaker through
the fasting." One day he notices that the priest
of the village is less pious than he. He enters
a convent in the hopes of finding there true
Christians. But even there his disillusionment
comes soon. Finally, he decides to found a
church of his own. He hires a little room which
he transforms into a chapel. He finds disciples
and soon gains a reputation as a thaumaturgical
saint.</p>

<p>A sect, of which he is to be the head, is in
process of formation, when, one day, he finds
that he is on the wrong track. He thinks he
has committed a mortal sin. Pride has taken
possession of him; it is the Devil and not God
who now directs his moves. Conscious of his
error, he returns to orthodoxy, and, in the
hopes of expiating his wrong-doing, he humiliates
himself everywhere and on every occasion.</p>

<p>But his cousin Jacob, having become infected
with his earlier ideas, practises them
with the fanatic ardor of a neophyte. With
his sister and several other religious people, he
locks himself into his house to pray; he sings
vespers and matins. In the meanwhile Matvey
decides that he must read Jacob a sermon.</p>

<p>"Be reasonable," he tells him repeatedly,
"repent, cousin. You will lose, because you
are the prey of the demon. Repent."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of repenting, Jacob and his sister
vow an implacable hatred against Matvey; so
extreme is their feeling, that one day, at the
end of an altercation, Jacob, blinded by rage,
kills his cousin.</p>

<p>He is judged and condemned. He is sent to
the island of Sakhaline. There, he languishes,
suffers, and despairs. But, little by little, his
mind grows peaceful, and he has consoling
visions. In prison he is surrounded by pariahs
and criminals, and the sight of all this human
suffering turns him again towards God, towards
the religion of Love, the religion of pity for
mankind. And now he wants to return to the
country to tell of the miracle that has taken
place in him, and to save souls from ill and
ignorance.</p>

<p>In "The Ravine" evil and injustice triumph
at times with revolting cynicism. Evil is in
everything and everywhere: "in the great
manufacturers who drive along the streets of
the village, crushing men and beasts; in the
bailiff and the recorder, who are such bad characters
that their very faces betray their knavery;"
and finally, in the central figure of the
story, Axinia, the wife of Stepan, the youngest
son of Tzibukine, a usurer and monopolist.</p>

<p>The unhealthy ravine hides a village inhabited
by factory workers. The best house belongs
to Gregory Tzibukine, who traffics in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
everything: brandy, wheat, cattle, lumber, and
usury, on the side. His eldest son, Anissme,
is employed at the police station and seldom
comes home; the second son, Stepan, is deaf
and sickly; he helps his father both well and
badly, and his wife, the pretty and coquettish
Axinia, runs all day between the cellar and the
shop. The father Tzibukine is also friendly
to her and respects this young woman, for she
is a very good worker and is most intelligent.
Tzibukine, a widower, has married Varvara, an
affable and pious soul who gives alms,&mdash;a
strange thing in this family who cheat everybody.
Anissme often sends home beautiful
letters and presents. One day, he comes unexpectedly;
he has an unquiet, and, at the same
time, flippant air. His parents have decided
to get him married, and, although he is a
drunkard, ugly and vulgar, they have found
him a pretty wife. The girl is Lipa, daughter
of a poor widow, a laborer like her mother.
Anissme whistles and looks at the ceiling, and
shows no signs of pleasure at his coming marriage.
He leaves the house in a strange manner,
and appears again three days before the
wedding, bringing to his parents, as gifts, some
newly coined money. The wedding day has
come. The clergy and the well-to-do of the
neighborhood are present at the dinner, which is
sumptuously served. Lipa seems petrified with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
fear, for she barely knows her husband. The
festivities last a long time; at intervals the
voices of women can be heard outside hurling
curses at the usurer. Then Anissme, red,
drunk, and sweating, is shoved into the room
where Lipa has already disrobed. Five days
later, Anissme comes to his mother and bids her
good-bye. He confides in her that some one
has given him advice, and that he has decided
either to become rich or to perish. Now that
her husband has departed, Lipa again becomes
gay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they have arrested a reaper accused
of having circulated a bad piece of
money which he says he received from Anissme
the night of the wedding. Tzibukine goes
home, examines the money that his son has
given him, and decides that it is all counterfeit.
He orders Axinia to throw every bit of it into
the well. But, instead of obeying, she pays it
out as wages to the workmen. A week passes;
they find out that Anissme has been thrown into
prison as a counterfeiter. Tzibukine despairs;
he feels his strength diminishing. Varvara continues
to pray and to watch, while Stepan
and Axinia continue to ply their trade as before.
When, later on, Anissme is sentenced to
ten years at hard labor in Siberia, Varvara suggests
to her husband that he should leave one
of his houses to the child which has just been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
born to Lipa, so that no one will speak badly of
him after his death. But, at this suggestion,
Axinia flies into such a fury, that, in her homicidal
rage, she throws a kettle of boiling water
over the child, who dies later at the hospital.
Finally, she drives the young woman out of the
house. Lipa returns to her mother. Soon
Axinia reigns as absolute mistress of the house.
Tzibukine becomes distracted; he does not take
care of his money any more, because he cannot
tell the good from the bad. Rumor has it that
his daughter-in-law is letting him die of hunger.
Varvara still goes on with her good work.
Anissme is forgotten. The old man, starving,
and driven from home, lodges a complaint
against the young woman. Coming back to
the village, the old man, tottering along the
street, meets Lipa and her mother, who are now
doing tile work.</p>

<p>"Both bow deeply to him, and he looks at
them with tears in his eyes. Lipa offers him
a piece of oatmeal cake, and the two women
go on their way, crossing themselves several
times...."</p>

<p>The virtuous Varvara is an extremely characteristic
type, with a subtle psychology, carefully
worked out; her honesty and goodness
form an indispensable contrast to the ambient
horrors.</p>

<p>The author himself explains the r&ocirc;le of Varvara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and her action in this system of evil.
"Her alms seem to be something strange, joyous
and free, like the red flowers and the lights
that glow before the saintly images." On holidays,
and on jubilees, which last three days,
when coarse and rotten meat is sold to the peasants
who come to pawn their scythes and hats,
or their wives' shawls; when the workingmen
lie in the gutter under the influence of bad
brandy, then "one feels a bit relieved at the
thought that down there, in that house, there
is a good and quiet woman, always ready to help
unfortunates."</p>

<p>Lipa and her mother are good and timid souls
who suffer in silence, and give to the poor the
little that they possess:</p>

<p>"It seemed to them that some one up on
high, further up than the azure, there among
the stars, saw what was going on in their village,
and watched. Big as the evil is, in spite
of it, the night is beautiful and calm; justice
is and will be calm and beautiful on God's earth
also; the universe awaits the moment when it
can melt into this justice, as the light of the
moon melts into the night."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These, then, are Tchekoff's favorite themes,
on which he has traced numerous variations, always
breathing forth a profound melancholy.</p>

<p>"The life of our industrial classes," he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"is dark, and drags itself along in sort of a
twilight; as to the life of our common people,
workingmen and peasants, it is a black night,
made up of ignorance, poverty, and all sorts of
prejudices."</p>

<p>But from this ocean of ignorance, of barbarity,
of misery which makes up the life of a
peasant, Tchekoff has taken out the things of
most importance, things that always happen
in the most solemn moments of their existence.</p>

<p>"All," he says, in describing a religious procession
in the country, "the old man, his wife
and the others, all stretch forth their hands to
the ikon of the holy Virgin, regard her ardently,
and say through their tears: 'Protectress!
Virgin protectress!' And all seem to have
understood that the space between Heaven and
Earth is not empty; that the rich and the
mighty have not swallowed up everything;
that there is protection against all wrongs,
slavery, misery, the fatal brandy...."</p>

<p>Besides, in a story entitled "My Life,"
Poloznev, speaking of the peasants, expresses
himself in the following manner:</p>

<p>"They were, for the most part, nervous and
irritable people, ignorant, and improvident,
who could think of nothing but the grey earth
and black bread; a people who were crafty,
but were stupid about it, like the birds, who,
when they want to hide themselves, only hide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
their heads. They would not do the mowing
for you for twenty rubles, but they would do it
for six liters of brandy, notwithstanding the
fact that with twenty rubles they can buy eight
times as much. What vice and foolishness!
Nevertheless, one feels that the life of the
peasant has a great deal of depth. It makes no
difference that he, behind his plough, resembles
an awkward beast, or that he gets intoxicated.
In spite of all, when you look at him closely,
you feel that he possesses the essential thing,
the sentiment of justice."</p>

<p>This love of justice Tchekoff has had occasion
to observe even among convicts. "The
convict," he says, in his book on the prison of
Sakhaline, of which he made a profound study
during his stay on the island, "the prisoner,
completely corrupted and unjust as he himself
is, loves justice more than any one else does,
and if he does not find it in his superiors, he
becomes angry, and grows baser and more distrustful
from year to year."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the last works of Tchekoff the pessimistic
tendency grows greater and greater. It seems
as if the writer had gone through a sort of
moral crisis, brought on by the conflict of his
old despair and his new hopes. At this time,
Russian society itself began to shake off its
apathy, and this awakening, sweeping like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
vivifying wave into the soul of the sad artist,
opened for him, at the same time, perspectives
of new ideas.</p>

<p>This second aspect of Tchekoff's talent is
perceptible in the story called "The Student."
A seminarist, Velikopolsky by name, tells the
gardener Vassilissa and her daughter Lukeria
about St.&nbsp;Peter's denial of Christ. As a result
of the impression which this story makes on
her Vassilissa suddenly breaks into tears; she
weeps a long time and hides her face as if she
were ashamed of crying. Lukeria, who has been
watching the student fixedly, blushes and her
face takes on the tender and sad expression
which is characteristic of those whose life is
made up of deep suffering. After taking leave
of them, the student thinks that Vassilissa's
tears and the emotion of her daughter come
from sorrows connected with the things he has
just told them.</p>

<p>"If the old woman wept, it was not because
he knew how to tell the story in a touching
manner, but because Peter was near to her, and
because she was interested, heart and soul, in
what was going on in the mind of the
apostle...."</p>

<p>Joy suddenly fills his heart, and he stops a
moment to take a long breath. "The past,"
he muses, "is bound to the present by an uninterrupted
chain of events." "And it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to him that he has just seen the two ends of
this chain: he has touched one, and the other
has vibrated...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In an ironical manner and by using very
personal material, Tchekoff paints more than
anything else, life in its passive or negative
manifestations. Nevertheless, it is not satire,
at least not in its general trend, for in his work
we find too much human tenderness for satire.
He does not laugh at his characters, and does
not nail them to the pillory in an outburst of
indignation. In his writing, the fundamental
idea is fused with the form; his talent is calm,
thoughtful, observing; but it seems, at times,
that this calmness, this seeming indifference, is
only a mask. A critic, speaking of Tchekoff,
has said: "He is a tender crayon." It would
be hard to find a more suitable expression.
The delicacy of tone, the softness of touch in
the outlines, the polish of some of the details,
the capricious incompleteness of others are, in
fact, the mark of his talent.</p>

<p>Tchekoff was such a voluminous author that
it would require a veritable effort to remember
the throng of characters which exists in his
books; and it is more than difficult not to confuse
their individual doings and achievements.
This abundance is connected with a peculiarity
in the author's talent. He does not exhaust his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
subject; the psychology of his characters is
emphasized by two or three expressive traits
only, and this epitome is enough to make the
theme of a story, the simplicity and naturalness
of which demand, nevertheless, a high degree
of art. The author is not interested in outlining
the details, but the picture that he has
sparingly conjured up stands out lifelike; he
is always in a hurry to observe and to tell.
Therefore the brevity and quantity of his
stories. His stories seldom exceed ten pages in
length, while some do not exceed four. They
constitute a series of sketches, of miniatures of
rare value, among which can be found some real
gems. One cannot say as much for his longer
works, where certain parts are exaggerated, as
in "The Valet de Chambre," "Ward No. 6,"
"The Steppe," and "The Duel."</p>

<p>The characters of the latter novel are especially
weak and bad. There is but one exception,
the zoologist von Koren, a man of determination,
who believes that the suppression of
useless people and degenerates would be a meritorious
piece of work. This idea is suggested
to him by the sight of a functionary called
Layevsky, an insignificant and lazy person,
who has taken the wife of one of his friends
and fled with her to the Caucasus.</p>

<p>"The Valet de Chambre" is an equally unsatisfactory
story. The principal character is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a young man who is supposed to be a revolutionist.
He enters the service of a Petersburg
dandy in hopes of meeting there a minister
whom he wants to kill. The employer of the
pseudo-lackey, who is not aware of any of his
projects, is a masterful presentation of a type
which we know as the sybaritical citizen; the
character of the valet is so fantastical that the
account of his adventures belongs absolutely
to the "genre" of the newspaper novel.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"Ward No. 6" is one of the most powerful,
if not the most powerful story that Tchekoff
has written. It is an analysis of moral degeneration,
leading progressively to insanity,
in a doctor who is seized by the pervasive banality
of the village in which he practises. Tchekoff,
like many other Russian writers, has shown
himself a master in the study of certain psychological
anomalies. Certain conversations
between the doctor, who himself is going mad,
and a patient who has long since lost his reason,
interesting as they are from a philosophical
standpoint, leave the world of reality and run
free according to the imagination of the author,
who takes advantage of this to formulate
some of his favorite theories.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tchekoff has also tried himself out on the
drama, and he has there established himself in
a peculiar manner. His plays, like his other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
literary productions, belong to two distinct
periods.</p>

<p>There are some amusing little trifles that do
not amount to much. Among these are: "The
Bear," "The Asking in Marriage," and others.
Then come the more serious plays, where one
feels for a moment the influence of Ibsen. We
find here again the same heroes, each of whom
talks about his own particular case, and acts
only in starts. These are specimens of "failures"
belonging to the most tiresome provincial
society.</p>

<p>In "Ivanov," the author studies the mentality
of a "failure." Dominated by a sickly
self-love, he has known nothing but losses. He
continually complains of his real and his imaginary
sufferings. After squandering all his fortune,
he marries a young girl, whom he wants
to have act as his nurse. This empty life ends
in suicide.</p>

<p>In "Uncle Vanya," we have Vanya, a man
full of goodness, modesty, and self-abnegation
contrasted with the celebrated professor Serebriakof,
an egoist, unfeeling, scornful, and ungrateful.
The latter, who has recently remarried,
comes back to the estate which Uncle
Vanya, the brother of his first wife, has managed
for him. For several years Vanya has
been working incessantly; he has saved in
every possible way so that he can send as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
money as possible to his brother-in-law, this
professor, fondled and pampered by the whole
family, who see in him their glorification. But
Serebriakof soon gets tired of the country; besides,
he thinks that the doctor&mdash;a friend of
the family who is taking care of him&mdash;does
not understand his sickness, and he begins to
mistrust him. He wants to go away, to travel,
in order to recover his health, and, in order to
make money, he proposes to sell the estate,
which legally belongs to Sonya, the daughter
of his first wife.</p>

<p>Up to this time Uncle Vanya and the other
members of the family as well, had sacrificed
themselves entirely to this celebrated man. But
at this proposition Vanya realizes that their
idol is nothing but an abominable egoist, and he
begins to despise his brother-in-law. What is
more, he secretly loves the young and beautiful
wife of the professor, while she suffers from
the everlasting complaints and caprices of her
husband. However, a general reconciliation
takes place. The professor and his wife leave
for the city, and all goes on as before; Uncle
Vanya and the family will sacrifice themselves
for the glory of Serebriakof, to whom all the
revenues of the estate are sent.</p>

<p>The "Three Sisters," that is to say the sisters
of Prozorov, live with their brother in a
vulgar, tiresome town,&mdash;a town lacking in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
men of superior minds, a town where one person
is like the next.</p>

<p>The great desire of the three sisters is to go
to Moscow, but their apathy keeps them in the
country, and they continue to vegetate while
philosophizing about everything that they see.
However, at the arrival of a regiment, they
become animated, and have sentimental intrigues
with the officers till the very day of
their departure.</p>

<p>"They are going to leave; we shall be alone;
the monotonous life is going to begin again,"
cries one of the sisters.</p>

<p>"We must work; work alone consoles," says
the second.</p>

<p>And the youngest exclaims, embracing her
two sisters, while the military band plays the
farewell march:</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sisters, your life is not yet
completed. We are going to live. The music
is so gay! Just a little bit more, and I feel that
we shall know why we live, why we suffer...."</p>

<p>This certainly is the dominant note of Tchekoff's
philosophy: the impotency of living mitigated
by a vague hope of progress.</p>

<p>The last, and perhaps the most important
play of Tchekoff, is "The Cherry Garden."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Human beings, locked up in themselves, morally
bounded, impotent and isolated, wander
about in the old seignioral estate of the Cherry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Garden. The house is several centuries old. In
former times a happy life was led there; feasts
were given, and generals and princes were the
hosts. The Cherry Garden gave tone to the
neighborhood, but many years have passed!...
Now other houses have taken its place:
the estate is mortgaged, the interest is not paid,
and the only guests now are the postman or a
railway official who lives close by. The occupants
of the house do not think of doing anything
about this state of things. For them the
past is gone. All that is left is a dislike for
work, carelessness, improvidence, and ignorance
of the necessities of the present. Like all that
dies, they evoke a certain pity, a certain fatality
hangs over them. The inhabitants of the
Cherry Garden set forth their ideas about one
another; but in reality none of them see anything
but themselves, in their small and very
limited moral world, and they analyze with difficulty
the embryos of thought that are left to
them. Thus, they cannot grasp in full the evil
that is falling on the old home, and they remain
impassive when some one proposes to alleviate
this evil by energetic means. People speak to
them of the downfall to which they are doomed;
a means of safety is proposed, but they turn a
deaf ear and continue in their narrow and fruitless
dream. Finally, when the estate is sold,
they look upon this event as a fatal and unexpected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
blow. They say good-bye to the cradle
of their family, weeping silently, and depart.</p>

<p>They are now thrown out into the world.
The old existence has gone, as well as the seignioral
estate. The Cherry Garden is to be
torn down; the blinds are all lowered, and in
the half-darkened rooms, the old servant, who
is nearly a century old, wanders about among
the disordered furniture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tchekoff is a true product of Russian literature,
an autochthon plant, nourished by his
natal sap. His humor is completely Russian;
we hear Tolstoyan notes in his democracy; the
"failures" of his stories are distantly related
to the "superficial characters" of Turgenev;
finally, the theory of the redemption of the past
by suffering which he puts in the heart of the
hero of the "Cherry Garden" makes us think
of Dostoyevsky. The qualities which call to
mind all these great names in Russian literature
are found in the works of Tchekoff along
with characteristics which show a very original
talent. If one wishes to look for foreign
influence, one can relate Tchekoff to de
Maupassant and Ibsen, of whom he reminds
one in snatches, although still in a very vague
way. And that is indeed fortunate, for, in general,
Scandinavian symbolism hardly goes hand
in hand with the Russian spirit, which likes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
make <i>direct</i> answers to "cursed questions," and
whose ideal, elaborated since 1840 in the realm
of strict realism, is so definite that it does not
necessitate going back to the circumlocutions
of metaphors and allegories.</p>

<p>While Tchekoff lived his literary aspect was
enigmatical. Some judged him to be indifferent,
because they did not find in his writings
that revolutionary spirit which is felt in almost
all modern writers. Others thought of him as
a pessimist who saw nothing good in Russian
life, because he described principally resigned
suffering or useless striving for a better life.
Since the death of Tchekoff, which made it
necessary for the critics to study his works as
a whole, and especially since the publication of
his correspondence, his character has come to
the fore, as it really is: he is a writer, who, by
the very nature of his talent, was irresistibly
forced to study the inner life of man impartially,
and who, consequently, remains the
enemy of all religious or philosophical dogmas
which may hinder the task of the observer.</p>

<p>The division of men into good and bad, according
to the point of view of this or that
doctrine, angered him:</p>

<p>"I fear," he says in one of his letters,
"those who look for hidden meanings between
the lines, and those who look upon me as a
liberator or as a guardian. I am neither a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
liberal nor a conservative, neither a monk nor
an indifferent person. I despise lies and violence
everywhere and under any form.... I
only want to be an artist, and that's all."</p>

<p>One realized that this unfettered artist, with
his hatred of lies and violence, although he belonged
to no political party, could be nothing
but a liberal in the noblest and greatest sense
of the word. One also realized that he was not
the pessimist that he was once believed to be,
but a writer who suffered for his ideal and who
awakened by his works a desire to emerge from
the twilight of life that he depicted.</p>

<p>To some he even appeared as an enchanted
admirer of the future progress of humanity.
Did he not often say, while admiring his own
little garden: "Do you know that in three or
four hundred years the entire earth will be a
flourishing garden? How wonderful it will be
to live then!" And did he not pronounce these
proud words: "Man must be conscious of being
superior to the lions, tigers, stars, in short, to
all nature. We are already superior and great
people, and, when we come to know all the
strength of human genius, we shall be comparable
to the gods."</p>

<p>These great hopes did not prevent him from
painting with a vigorous brush the nothingness
of mankind, not only at a certain given moment
and under certain circumstances, but always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and everywhere. Is this a paradox? No. If
he did not doubt progress, he would be most
pessimistic, if I may so express myself. He
would suffer from that earthly pessimism, in
face of which reason is weak; the pessimism
which manifests itself by a hopeless sadness in
face of the stupidity of life and the idea of
death.</p>

<p>"I, my friend, am afraid of life, and do not
understand it," says one of Tchekoff's heroes.
"When, lying on the grass, I examine a lady-bird,
it seems to me that its life is nothing but
a texture of horrors, and I see myself in it....
Everything frightens me because I understand
neither the motive nor the end of things. I
understand neither persons nor things. If you
understand I congratulate you.</p>

<p>"When one looks at the blue sky for a long
time, one's thoughts and one's soul unite mysteriously
in a feeling of solitude.... For a
moment one feels the loneliness of the dead, and
the enigma of hopeless and terrible life."</p>

<p>This universal hopelessness; this sadness,
provoked by the platitudes of existence compared
with the unrelenting lessons of death, of
which Tchekoff speaks with such a nervous
terror, can be found in almost all the works of
the best known Russian writers. We find it in
Byronian Lermontov, who sees nothing in life
but "une plaisanterie;" in Dostoyevsky, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
has written so many striking pages of realism
on the bitterness of a life without religious
faith; and in the realist Turgenev, we find the
same kind of thing. Turgenev even reaches a
stage of hopeless nihilism, and one of his heroes,
Bazarov,&mdash;in "Fathers and Sons,"&mdash;reflecting
one day on the lot of the peasant, considering
it better than his, says sadly, "He, at
least, will have his little hut, while all I can hope
for is a bed of thorns." Finally, all the tortuous
quests of the ideal toward which Tolstoy
strove, were suggested to him, as he himself
says, by his insatiable desire to find "the meaning
of life, destroyed by death."</p>

<p>It is sometimes maintained that this state of
intellectual sadness is innate in the Russians;
that their sanguinary and melancholy temperaments
are a mixture of Don Quixote and Hamlet.
Foreign critics have often traced this
despair to the so-called mysticism peculiar to
the Slavonic race.</p>

<p>What is there mystical in them? The consciousness
of the nothingness, of the emptiness
of human life, can be found deep down in the
souls of nearly all mankind. It shows itself,
among most people, only on rare tragic occasions,
when general or particular catastrophes
take place; at other times it is smothered by
the immediate cares of life, by passions that
grip us, and, finally, by religion. But none of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
these influences had any effect on Tchekoff.
He was too noble to be completely absorbed by
the mean details of life; his organism was too
delicate to become the prey of an overwhelming
passion; and his character too positive to give
itself over to religious dogmas. "I lost my
childhood faith a long time ago," he once
wrote, "and I regard all intelligent belief with
perplexity.... In reality, the 'intellectuals'
only play at religion, chiefly because they have
nothing else to do." Tchekoff, in his sober
manner, has seen and recognized the two great
aspects of life: first, the world of social and
historical progress with its promise of future
comforts; secondly, an aspect that is closely
related to the above, the obscure world of the
unknown man who feels the cold breath of
death upon him. He was an absolute positivist;
his positivism did not make him self-assertive
nor peremptory; on the contrary, it oppressed
him.</p>

<p>But why should this sad state of mind, which
has been expressed by great men in all literatures,
be so exceptionally prominent among the
Russians, and particularly among the modern
ones? The reason is, without a doubt, because
the political and social organization of Russia
has always been a prison for literature. Oppression
had reached its height during Tchekoff's
life. This period was the moment of suffocation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
before the storm. If Tchekoff were
alive to-day, now that the tempest has burst
forth, his sadness would be lessened, or it would
at least have before it the screen which, according
to Pascal, people wear before their eyes
that they may not see the abyss, on the edge
of which they pass their lives. Up to the present
time, the Russians have lacked these
screens.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br />
VLADIMIR KOROLENKO</h2>


<p>"A long time ago, on a dark autumn evening,
I was being rowed down a rather uninteresting
Siberian stream. Suddenly, at a
bend in the river, I saw a bright fire burning
ahead of us at the foot of some black mountains.
It did not seem far away.</p>

<p>"'Thank Heaven,' I cried with joy, 'we have
nearly reached our stopping-place!'</p>

<p>"The boatsman turned, looked at the fire
over his shoulder, and again grasped the oars
with an apathetic gesture:</p>

<p>"'That is still a long way off,' he murmured.</p>

<p>"I did not believe him, for the fire seemed
to stand out very clear against the infinite
shadows. However, he was right; we were still
far away.</p>

<p>"Just so those fires, the conquerors of darkness,
deceive us into thinking that they are near,
while they only cast their distant, illusive rays
into the night...."</p>

<p>It is with this sober description in "Little
Fires" that one of the last volumes of Korolenko's
"Sketches and Stories" opens. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
simple picture makes a warm and clear impression
on one's very soul. It is itself a
precious and welcome light.</p>

<p>At times when life is sombre, and when
shadows fill the heart, when, under the blows
of despair and anguish, courage finally fails,
the mere existence of some brave spirit suffices
to give a new birth to hope and to rekindle the
flame so that the distance is again lighted up,
and we again put our shoulders to the wheel.</p>

<p>Thus for more than thirty years in Russian
literature Korolenko has played the part of
one of these clear, alluring lights. He has not
written a single book in which we do not find
a fire that warms us with its caresses even from
afar, not one in which we do not feel the vibration
of a loving heart, which dreams of giving
light and joy to all unfortunates, and is confident
that if they have not yet had their equal
share, they will surely have it some day.</p>

<p>Korolenko was born in 1853 in Zhitomir, in
Little Russia. On his father's side he is descended
from an old Cossack family, and by his
mother he is related to Polish nobility. This
double origin, so to speak, is shown very clearly
in his works, which are filled with the melancholy
and dreamy poetry of the Little Russians,
and also with the perennial hope so common
among the Poles.</p>

<p>His father was a judge and enjoyed a reputation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
for strict integrity. It was, in fact,
often hard for him to ward off those who
wanted to thank him for his services. One day
he had to accept a gift. A merchant, whose
case he had won, sent him a cart filled with
various objects, among which was a beautiful
large doll. The little daughter of the judge
saw it, and at once took possession of it. The
judge, when he found out what had happened,
ordered the gifts to be returned immediately;
but, because of the grief of the little girl, they
had to give up all thoughts of returning the
doll.</p>

<p>The judge, who was a man of firm principles,
maintained a severe discipline in his family.
He made a special study of medicine and
hygiene, and put his knowledge into practice
by treating the sick of the neighborhood. His
children, although always well dressed, had to
go around barefoot. Their father was convinced
that this was the best way to toughen
them. Besides, they were compelled, every
morning, summer and winter, to take a cold
plunge bath. The children did not like this
way of doing things. Early in the morning
they used to run to the stable in their shirts,
and there, cowering in a corner, trembling with
cold, they would wait for their father to leave
the house.</p>

<p>Korolenko remembers well this Spartan-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
education, which inured him to the severity of
the seasons. Without this training he certainly
would have perished in savage and freezing
Siberia, where he lived in exile for several years.</p>

<p>At the death of the father, the family with
its six children was left without resources. The
mother, a very good and kind woman, opened
a boys' boarding-school, and Vladimir, then
fifteen years of age, helped her as well as he
could, and also earned money by giving lessons
outside.</p>

<p>In 1870, after having finished his studies in
his native town, Korolenko entered the Technological
Institute at St.&nbsp;Petersburg, where he
spent two years in extreme poverty. He had
to earn his living as well as he could, by giving
lessons or doing copying. His mother could
not help him at all, as she herself had to struggle
against adversity. The following will show
how sparingly he had to live in his youth:
during his two years, he had a real substantial
meal only about once in two months, and then
in a restaurant run on philanthropic principles,
where he paid only 30 copecks (about 30 cents).
His regular meals consisted of bread, tea,
sausage and potatoes. But this was an epoch
in which living was cheap: the wave of democracy
was spreading, and the "intellectuals"
were trying to get into closer touch with the
people. The movement was so powerful that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
many of the younger generation who could have
done other things took up this work; others,
on principle, married humble peasants. In
1872 Korolenko left for Moscow, and there
entered the Academy of Agriculture. He was
expelled after two years and sent to Kronstadt
for having taken part in student manifestations.
Several years later, we find him again in St.&nbsp;Petersburg
without a permanent position; he
was employed as a reader in a publishing house,
and was also attempting to do some writing.
His first efforts took the form of a series of
sketches, published under the title, "Episodes
in the Life of a Seeker." He was at this time
accused of being too much inspired by the
scenes of sadness and injustice of which he had
been a witness. In 1879 he was imprisoned and
then deported to Viatka. He remained there
a year. Thence he was sent to the miserable
town of Kama, and a few months later to
Tomsk, where he learned that they wanted to
exile him to Siberia. In a letter, published by
a newspaper, he eloquently protested against
the persecutions of which he was the unhappy
victim. His protestation was answered by his
transfer to the frozen region of the province
of Yakutsk in Eastern Siberia! He passed
three years in the midst of the "taiga," the
immense virgin forest which covers this country,
in a village of nomads whose miserable huts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
very low and smoky, were scattered along the
shores of the Aldane. Here he wrote several
stories, and the "Dream of Makar," which
was published two years later, and greatly
praised by the critics for its originality and its
setting. The dreary country around Yakutsk
and the life that is lived there made such a
profound impression on the young man that
even to-day he speaks of that time with real
emotion.</p>

<p>"My hut was at the extreme end of the
town. During the short day one could see
the small plain, the mountains which surrounded
it, and the fires in the other huts, in
which lived people who were either descended
from Russian colonists or deported Tartars.
But in the morning and evening a cold grey
mist covered everything so thickly that one
could not see a foot ahead.</p>

<p>"My little hut was like a lost island in a
boundless ocean. Not a sound about me....
The minutes, the hours passed, and insensibly
the fatal moment approached when the 'cursed
land' pierced me with the hostility of its freezing
cold and its terrible shadows, when the high
mountains covered with black forests rose
menacingly before me, the endless steppes, all
lying between me and my country and all that
was dear to me.... Then came the terrible
sadness ... which, in the depths of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
heart, suddenly lifts up its sinister head, and
in the terrible silence among the shadows murmurs
these words: 'This is the end of you ...
the very end ... you will remain in this tomb
till you die....'</p>

<p>"A low and caressing whine brought me out
of my heavy stupor: it was my friend, Cerberus,
my intelligent and faithful dog, who had
been placed as a sentinel near the door. Chilled
through and through, he was asking me what
was the matter and why, in such terribly cold
weather, I did not have a fire.</p>

<p>"Whenever I felt that I was going to be
beaten in my struggle with silence and the
shadows, I turned to this wholesome expedient,&mdash;a
large fire."</p>

<p>In 1885, Korolenko, having returned from
Siberia, went to Nizhny-Novgorod, and in a
relatively short space of time wrote a series of
stories which, two years later, were collected in
book form. Afterward, he became the editor
of the celebrated St.&nbsp;Petersburg review, the
"Russkoe Bogatsvo,"&mdash;a position which he
still holds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In all of Korolenko's works we distinctly feel
the living breath that inspires the artist, and
the ardor of a fervent ideal. His god is man;
his ideal, humanity; his "leitmotiv," the
poetry of human suffering. This intimate connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
with all that is human is to be found
in his psychological analysis as well as in his
descriptions of natural phenomena. Both God
and nature are in turn spiritualized and humanized.
Korolenko looks at life from a human
standpoint; the world which he describes is
made up wholly of men and exists for them
only. He has a very clear philosophy, and a
conscience aware of the duties it has to perform.
If he has not opened up hitherto unknown
paths, nor made new roads, he has himself
nevertheless passed through terrible experiences;
he has been a prey to profound sorrows
and doubts, and in spite of all, he has
kept his love for the people intact, and deeply
pities their ignorance and abasement. His work
constantly recalls to our minds the theory that
the cultivated classes are in debt to the people
for the education which they have received at
the people's expense. This is the great moral
principle which governs the conscience of the
Russian "intellectuals." It is in this sense then,
that Korolenko may be said to continue the
literature of 1870, and to be the successor of
Zlatovratsky and Uspensky. But he has reincarnated
this past in new forms, which naturally
result from the activity of his far-sighted,
powerful intelligence. We do not find in his
work either the nervousness, often sickly, which
pervades the works of Uspensky, or the optimism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of Zlatovratsky, which often excessively
idealizes the life of the Russian peasant, who is
the principal hero of all his works. Korolenko,
because he puts a high value on human personality,
perfectly appreciates the terrible struggle
that man has to make in order to secure his
rights. A desire for justice on the one hand,
and a defence of man's dignity on the other,
form the very essence of the talent of this author,
and it is with these feelings that he observes
the people on whom injustice weighs most
heavily and who have merely remnants of human
dignity left in their make-up,&mdash;for in general,
these people are not those whom fate has overcome.
Most of them lead a hard and gloomy
life beset with misfortunes. Many of them are
vagabonds, escaped convicts, drunkards, murderers,
who are bowed down with misery, and
have no wish except to escape the mortal dangers
of the Siberian forests and marshes. On
opening any of Korolenko's books we find ourselves,
to use his own words, in "bad company."
He does not flatter his heroes, he does not make
gentlemen of them; they are not even men, but
rather human rubbish.</p>

<p>"Because I knew a lot about the world," he
writes, "I knew that there were people who had
lost every vestige of humanity. I knew that
they were corroded with vice and sunk deep in
debauchery, in which they lived contented. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
when the recollection of these beings surged
through my mind, enveloped in the mists of the
past, I saw nothing but a terrible tragedy, and
felt only an inexpressible sorrow...."</p>

<p>This author does not give any judgment on
life; he does not condemn it and does not nourish
a preconceived spite against it, but his sad
heart overflows with pity, and, if he approaches
this life, it is with the balm of love, in order to
try to dress its terrible wounds.</p>

<p>For Korolenko, the sufferings of existence
atone for its injustice; he does not perceive
the iniquities that surround him except through
the prism of sorrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the very beginning of his literary career,
in his first book, "Episodes in the Life
of a Seeker," Korolenko shows himself to be a
seeker after truth. With him, the understanding
of life, so ardently sought after, is never
summed up in a single solution. He dreams of
it constantly; at times, he seems to have found
it, but he loses track of it again and starts all
over.</p>

<p>This groping about resulted in a moral crisis
in which he looked forward to death with joy.
Beset with the thought of suicide, he often
prowled around railroad platforms and looked
at the car-wheels.</p>

<p>"I went there and came back again," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
writes, "depressed by my realization of the
stupidity of life. The snow was falling all
around me, and shaping itself into a frozen
carpet, the telegraph poles shivered as if they
were cold through and through, and on the
other side of the road, on a slope, shone the sad
little light of the watchman's tower. There, in
the darkness, lived a whole family. Through
the shadows the little red fire seemed to be as
desolate as the family. The children were
scrofulous and suffered; the mother was thin
and sickly. To procreate and to bury! Such
was the life of the father, probably the most
unfortunate of all, because the household depended
wholly upon him, and he saw no gleam
of hope anywhere. He bore this condition of
things, because, in his simplicity, he believed
in a superior will, and thought that his misery
was inevitable. The resignation of this man,
the terrible bareness of his obscure existence,
oppressed me. If I could bear the sight of it,
it was only because I hoped; I thought that
we should soon find the road which makes life
happier, more agreeable to every one. How,
where, in what manner? What a mystery! But
the future beauty of life was in the search for
it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The observations that Korolenko was able to
make were many and diverse. By going all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
over Russia he gathered inexhaustible riches,
in the form of anecdotes and actual experiences.
This can be easily realized when we consider the
sumptuous variety of his descriptions. Where
do we not go, and whom do we not meet in his
books? First, we are in a peaceful little town
of the southwest, then in the thick woods of
Poliyessye, in the snow-covered and frozen
Siberian forests, or in the valleys of Sakhaline,
inhabited by half-breed Russians and escaped
convicts, not to mention the innumerable
sectarians who fill the Siberian prisons. And
Korolenko never repeats. Not even a detail
occurs more than once. Each of his works is
a little world in itself. The author, moreover,
unlike other writers, is never satisfied with pale
sketches; each character is shown in full relief,
each picture is absolutely finished. This wholeness,
this finish which does not hurt the harmony
of the proportions, is a precious quality,
very rare in our time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The "Sketches of a Siberian Tourist," published
in 1896, in which bandits of various odd
types tell thrilling tales of nocturnal attacks
and other adventures, is a kind of artistic novel.
The postillion is the most original character in
the book. Huge of stature, audacious and
clever, he exercises a mysterious influence over
the brigands, whom he inspires with a superstitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
terror. Most of them, thinking him
invulnerable, do not dare attack the travelers
whom he is driving.</p>

<p>That same year another work of Korolenko's
appeared, called: "In Bad Company,"&mdash;a
sort of autobiography which added to his renown.
The story, poetically simple, is laid in a
provincial town. The hero is a little, seven-year-old
boy called Volodya. He is the son of
the local judge. The mother has been dead for
a long time, and the father, in his sorrow, more
or less loses track of his children, who roam
about unwatched.</p>

<p>The little town has its historic legends; it
boasts of the ruins of a castle, which in times
gone by was inhabited by rich Polish counts,
whose descendants, having become poor, have
long since left their manorial home. The castle
has served as a refuge for a nomadic population.
Expelled by the count's agent, this little
band has taken up its abode in a dilapidated
chapel in the crypts of a cemetery.</p>

<p>The chief of this barefoot brigade is called
Tibertius Droba. He has two children:
Vanek, a large, dark-haired lad, whom one sees
wandering about the village with a sullen look
on his face, and Maroussya, a small and thin
child, who is gradually fading away in the
darkness of her cellar-like home.</p>

<p>While strolling about one day, Volodya, impelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
by his childish curiosity, decides, with
two of his friends, to explore the chapel. He
meets there Tibertius' children and they strike
up a friendship. The description of the ruins
and of the superstitious fear of the children
gives an opportunity for some exquisite pages.
If the little vagabonds are hungry, poor Volodya,
who himself is without love or caresses,
suffers still more, but every time that he brings
the children some apples or cakes he feels that
he is less unhappy, because these offerings are
accepted with such an outpouring of gratitude.
Gradually, the little lad gets to know all the
inhabitants, and becomes especially intimate
with Maroussya, whose eyes have an expression
of precocious desolation.</p>

<p>"Her smile," says Korolenko, "reminded me
of my mother during the last few months of her
life; so much so, that I almost used to weep
when I watched this little girl."</p>

<p>One day, Volodya brings her some apples,
flowers, and a doll that his little sister has
given him.</p>

<p>"Why is she always so sad?" he asks Maroussya's
brother.</p>

<p>"It is on account of the grey stone," he
replies.</p>

<p>"Yes, the grey stone," repeated Maroussya,
like a feeble echo.</p>

<p>"What grey stone?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"The grey stone that has sucked the life
out of her," explained Vanek, gazing at the sky.
"Tibertius says so, and Tibertius knows everything."</p>

<p>"I was very much puzzled, but the force with
which Tibertius' omniscience was affirmed impressed
me. I looked at the little girl, who
was still playing with the flowers, but almost
without moving. There were dark rings under
her eyes and her face was pale. I did not
exactly understand the meaning of Tibertius'
words, but I felt dimly that they veiled some
terrible reality. The grey stone was, in fact,
sucking out the life of this frail child. But
how could grey stones do it? How could this
hard and formless thing worm itself into
Maroussya's very soul, and make the ruddy
glow disappear from her cheeks and the brilliancy
from her eyes? These mysteries puzzled
me more than the phantoms of the castle."</p>

<p>Volodya's father is not aware that he is
spending part of his days in the cemetery, and
knows nothing of his son's new friends. But
one day the secret is discovered, and a family
storm follows. The judge demands a full confession.
Volodya heroically remains silent.
Finally, Tibertius himself pleads the child's
cause so eloquently that Volodya is not scolded
and the father allows him to go and say good-bye
to his little friend, who has meanwhile died
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of privation. The day after the little girl's
funeral the whole band disappears without
leaving a trace behind them. "Later on," says
Korolenko, "when we were about to leave our
home, it was on the grave of our poor little
friend that my sister and I, both of us full of
life, faith, and hope, interchanged our vows of
universal compassion...."</p>

<p>Another short story, called "The Murmuring
Forest," which was published in the same
year, made as much of a success as "Bad Company."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is in "The Blind Musician" that
Korolenko attains perfection. This masterly
psychological study does not present a very
complicated plot. From the very start the
reader is captivated by a powerful poetic quality,
free from all artifice, fresh, spontaneous,
and breathing forth such moral purity, such
tender pity, that one literally feels regenerated.</p>

<p>Here is a brief outline of this exquisite story.
One very dark night, a child of rich parents is
born in the southwest of Russia. Peter&mdash;the
child&mdash;is blind. His whole life is to be but a
groping in the shadows toward the light. The
mother adores the poor child and suffers more
than he. But she has not enough moral
strength to bring him up, and give him the
necessary comfort and energy. His father, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
countryman, thinks only of his business. Happily,
there is on the mother's side an uncle called
Maxim, one of the famous "thousand" of
Garibaldi, who has a noble and generous disposition.
It is he who brings up the child, with
a tenderness just touched by severity. Peter's
young mind is constantly enriched with new
pictures. Thanks to the extreme acuteness of
his hearing, he catches the very slightest sounds
of nature. When barely five years of age the
boy shows his love for music; he spends hours,
motionless, listening to the playing of one of
the servants who has made for himself a kind
of flute. Soon Peter begins to study music,
and especially the violin. His rapid progress
astonishes his teachers. However, in spite of
his love for music and the comfort that it gives
him, the blind boy suffers from his infirmity.
To distract his mind from his own suffering,
his uncle takes him one day to a place where
there are some blind beggars. Peter listens to
their plaintive melody: "Alms, alms for a poor
blind man ... for the love of Christ"; and
as if he had heard the voice of some phantom,
the child returns home, frightened, confused.
From that day, he is transformed. Until then,
he had thought only of himself, he had become
grey with his own sorrow. Afterward, he suffers
for others; his personal sorrow diminishes,
and his life becomes an expression of the sorrows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of his fellows in misery, an ardent and
passionate prayer for others who also are deprived
of sight.</p>

<p>For several years he has been friends with a
young girl of his neighborhood. They marry,
and Evelyn, his wife, brings some happiness to
the poor blind man. But soon there comes a
time of indescribable anguish. Evelyn gives
birth to a boy, and Peter is tortured by a presentiment
of impending evil. Will the son be
blind like his father? The few moments when
the doctors are testing the infant's sight pass
like so many centuries. Finally the physician
says: "The pupil is contracting, the child is
not blind." Peter, seated by the window, pale
and motionless, rises quickly at these words.
In a moment fear has disappeared and hope is
transformed into certainty and fills the blind
man's heart with joy. "The child is not blind."
One might say that these few words of the
doctor had burned a path in his brain.</p>

<p>"His whole frame vibrated like a taut cord
which had been snapped. A flash went through
him, like lightning in a sunless sky, conjuring
up in him strange phantasms. Whether they
were sounds or sights he could not determine.
But if they were sounds they were sounds which
he could see. They sparkled like the vault of
the sky, shone like the sun, waved like the rustling,
whispering grass of the steppes. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
were the sensations of a moment. What followed
he was unable to recall. But he stubbornly
affirmed that in this moment he had
<i>seen</i>. What had he seen? How had he seen?
Had he really seen? This always remained a
mystery. People said that it was impossible.
He, however, affirmed that in that moment he
had seen the earth, his wife, his mother, his son,
and Uncle Maxim.... He was standing up,
and his face was so illumined and so strange
that every one around him was silent....
Later on, there remained nothing but the remembrance
of a sort of joyous satisfaction,
and the absolute conviction that, at that moment,
he had seen...."</p>

<p>A year later, at Kiev, at a concert for charity,
Peter made his d&eacute;but. An enormous crowd
gathered to hear the blind musician. From the
very first the audience was captivated. Moved
to its depths, the crowd became frantic. And
Uncle Maxim heard something familiar in the
playing of his nephew.</p>

<p>He saw a large, crowded street, and a clear,
gay wave of scolding and jesting humanity.
Then, gradually, this picture faded into the
background. A groaning was heard. It detached
itself from the clamor of the crowd and
passed through the hall in a sweet but powerful
note, which sobbed and moved one's heart.
Maxim knew it well, this sad melody: "Alms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
alms for the poor blind man ... for the love
of Christ."</p>

<p>"He understands suffering," murmured the
uncle. "He has had his share, and that is why
he can change it into music for this happy
audience."</p>

<p>"And the head of the old warrior sank on his
breast. His work was done. He had made a
good man. He had not lived in vain. He had
but to look at the crowd to be convinced of
that."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Korolenko belongs to the school of Turgenev.
In all of his works he remains true to
the principles which his master summed up in
a letter: "One must penetrate the surroundings,
and take life in all its manifestations;
decipher the laws by which it is governed; get
at the very essence of life, while remaining always
within the boundaries of truth; and
finally, one must not be contented with a superficial
study."</p>

<p>Korolenko lives up to all of these principles.
Without tiring, he watches life in all of its
phases. He uses a large canvas for his studies
of inanimate nature, as well as of individuals in
particular and the masses in general. That is
why his work gives us such an exact reproduction
of life.</p>

<p>Like Turgenev, he describes nature admirably.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
His descriptions are not irrelevant ornaments,
but they constitute an organic and integral
part of the picture. In both Turgenev
and Korolenko the surrounding country reflects
the feelings and emotions of the heroes, and
takes on a purely lyric character. One might
almost say that these country scenes breathe,
speak a human language, and whisper mysterious
legends.</p>

<p>Korolenko has given us several splendid landscapes.
In some of these nature seems to be
in a serene mood, like a good mother whose
harmonious strength attracts man and shows
him the need of reposing on her bosom. In
others, nature is like a strong, free element
which incites man to lead an independent life.
Thus, in the beautiful prose poem, "The Moment,"
in which the action passes in Spain, it
is the ocean beating against the prison walls
that arouses Diatz from his torpor and makes
him attempt to escape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, in spite of the importance of the background
in Korolenko's work, it is really in the
conscience of his characters that the essential
drama takes place. More than anything else,
it is psychology that beguiles the artist; it is
only through psychology that Korolenko depicts
men and their mentalities. He studies the
strong and the weak, the simple and the complex;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
exaltation, triumph, revolt, and downfall
all interest him equally.</p>

<p>A simple analysis of his story, "Makar's
Dream," will show his psychological genius to
greater advantage than could any critical essay.</p>

<p>In the very heart of the dense woods of the
"taiga," Makar, a poor little peasant, who has
become half savage by association with the
Yakutsk people, dreams of a better future.</p>

<p>Makar does not dream, however, when he is
normal; he hasn't time to, for he has to chop
wood, plough, sow, and grind grain. He only
dreams when he is drunk. As soon as he is under
the influence of liquor, he weeps and says
that he is going to leave everything and go to
the "sacred mountain" to gain salvation for
his soul. What is the name of this mountain?
Where is it? He does not know exactly; he
only knows that it is very far away. On Christmas
eve, Makar extorts a ruble from two political
refugees, and, instead of bringing them
some wood for the money, he quickly buys some
tobacco and brandy. After drinking and
smoking a great deal, Makar goes to sleep and
has a dream. He dreams that the frost has
got the better of him in the woods, that he has
died there, and that the priest Ivan, who has
also been dead a long time, takes him to the
great Tayon&mdash;the god of the woods&mdash;to be
judged for his former deeds. Even there his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
natural knavery does not forsake him; he tries
to fool Tayon. But the latter has everything
that Makar has ever done, both good and bad,
written down, and becoming angry, he says:
"I see that you are a liar, a sluggard, and a
drunkard."</p>

<p>He orders Makar to be transformed into a
post-horse, to be used by the police commissioner.
And Makar, this Makar who never in
his lifetime was known to say more than ten
words at a time, suddenly finds that he has the
faculty of speech. He begins by saying that
he does not want to be a horse, not because he
is afraid of work but because this decision is
unfair. If one works geldings, one feeds them
with oats; but people have imposed upon him
and tortured him all his life and have never fed
him, no, not even with oats.</p>

<p>"Who imposed upon you and tortured
you?" asks old Tayon, moved by compassion.</p>

<p>"Everybody! The men who demanded taxes,
the heat and the cold, rain and dryness, the pitiless
earth, and the forest."</p>

<p>The beam of the balance wavers; the wooden
dish, filled with sins, rises, while the golden one
sinks.</p>

<p>Makar continues: "You have everything
written down, have you? Well, look and see
whether Makar has ever had any kindness
shown to him. He is here before his judges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
dirty, his hair disordered, and his clothes in
rags. He is ashamed. However, he realizes
that he was born just like the others, with clear
eyes in which both heaven and earth were reflected,
and with a heart ready to open and receive
all the beauty of the world."</p>

<p>Makar thus passes in review his miserable life.
Old Tayon is moved.</p>

<p>"Makar, you are no longer on earth, and you
shall receive justice."</p>

<p>Makar begins to weep, and Tayon weeps too....
And the young gods and the angels, they
also shed tears.</p>

<p>Again the balance moves. But this time it
is in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Makar has received justice from the hands
of Tayon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Korolenko does not try to reconcile us to
reality, but to mankind. In all of the catastrophes
in his books, in the most sombre descriptions,
he comforts us with a consolation,
an ideal, a "little fire" that burns in the distance
and attracts us. But to get to that fire
we have to fight against evil. And it is perhaps
in answer to Tolstoy's doctrine of passive resistance
that Korolenko wrote that beautiful
story called, "The Legend of Florus," the subject
of which was probably taken from "The
War of the Jews," by Flavius Josephus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>This work takes us back to the time when
Jud&aelig;a was bowed down under Roman rule. The
Jews bear their lot without a murmur, and this
resignation encourages Florus, the governor of
Jud&aelig;a, to oppress them more.</p>

<p>Soon there are two parties formed: the
"pacifics" want to rid themselves of Roman
cruelty by humble submission, while the others
advise opposing this cruelty to the utmost.
The chief of the latter party is Menahem, the
son of a famous warrior who has inherited
from his father his generous passions and his
hatred of oppression. Menahem's words inspire
respect even in his enemies. But he does
not succeed in making peace among his people.
In vain he cries to them, as his father before
him had cried: "It is disgraceful to bow down
to sovereigns, especially since these sovereigns
are men; no human being should bow down to
any one excepting God, who created men that
they might be free." With great trouble he
finally succeeds in rousing a part of the people
to rebellion. Then he leaves the city with his
followers, resolved to defend his country.
Menahem has no illusions as to the outcome;
he knows that he will be conquered by the
Romans. Nevertheless he is fearless, for his
whole being is filled with a single thought,&mdash;the
idea of justice, which imposes upon men
certain obligations which they must not scorn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>During his stay in Siberia Korolenko had a
very good chance to observe the deported convicts.
Most of them are thieves, forgers, and
murderers. The others, urged on by a heroic
desire to live their own true lives, have been
sent to this "cursed land" because of "political
offences."</p>

<p>Korolenko is not resigned to the sadness of
life, he is not an enemy to manly calls to
active struggle, but he neither wants to, nor
can he, break the ties that bind him to the real
life of the present. He does not wish either to
judge or to renounce this life. Nor does he
try, by fighting, to perpetuate a conflict which
is in itself eternal. If he struggles, it is rather
in discontent than in despair. Not all is evil
in his eyes, and reality is not always and entirely
sad. His protestations hardly ever take
the form of disdain or contempt; he does not
rise to summits which are inaccessible to mankind.
In fact, his ideal is close to earth; it is
the ideal which comes from mankind, from tears
and sufferings. If the thoughts and feelings
of the author rise sometimes high above the
earth, he never forgets the world and its interests.
Korolenko loves humanity, and his
ideals cannot separate themselves from it. He
loves man and he believes that God lives in their
souls.</p>

<p>We find these theories in the sketch called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"En Route." The vagabond, Panov, is one
of a party of deported convicts. At one of
the stops, an inspector arrives who remembers
having seen Panov when a young man. The
old man goes over the history of his life, which
has been marked with constant success, with
pleasure. He shows the vagabond his little
son, and with cruel egotism boasts of his happiness.
Standing before him, his back bent,
and a sad light in his eyes, Panov listens to the
story. He feels vaguely that he has not lived
and that he lacks personality. There is nothing
in store for him except the useless existence
of prison life. The egotistical and debonair
inspector, in his simplicity, does not understand
the anguish of the homeless prisoner, and,
by his amicable chatter, subjects him to horrible
moral torture. It is too much for Panov.
When the inspector leaves, Panov, gripping the
edge of his hard cot in his convulsive hands,
falls to the ground. He breathes heavily, his
lips move, but he does not speak. "That night
Panov got drunk."</p>

<p>Two very different types appear in the novel
called, "The Postillion of the Emperor." We
have here the idealist Misheka and the sectarian
Ostrovsky, a transported prisoner who is embittered
by his hard lot, and by life in general.</p>

<p>If Misheka protests against the complicated
conditions of life to which he cannot entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
submit, it is rather by instinct than through
reason. He is attracted by something invisible,
something distant and strange, to the repugnant
world which surrounds him. As a postillion
of the State he has frequent communications
with the distant world which glows
vaguely on his mental horizon. Everything
displeases him: both the savage country in
which he has to live, and the world of stupid,
degenerate, and miserable postillions whom he
mercilessly criticizes. His random attempts to
get away fail. Despairing, he becomes an accomplice
in a crime so that he can leave this
solitary place and go where his restless soul
leads him.</p>

<p>At the side of Misheka we have the tragic
figure of Ostrovsky, who is the exasperated victim
of the evil all around him.</p>

<p>The author and the travelers, driven by
Misheka, have seen the burning of Ostrovsky's
house, which the latter burned himself so that
no one could profit by it. This action strikes
Misheka as wonderful.</p>

<p>"He begins to tell the story of the fire.
Several years before, Ostrovsky had been deported
for having given up the orthodox faith.
His young wife and child followed him. They
had been given a plot of land in a broad and
deep valley, between two walls of rock. The
place seemed fertile. It was not hard to sell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
wheat to the miners and Ostrovsky worked diligently
and steadily. But the inhabitants had
kept something from him: although the wheat
grew in the valley, it never ripened, because
each year, without fail, in the month of July
it was destroyed by the cold winds from the
northeast."</p>

<p>The first few years Ostrovsky attributed his
failure to chance. He carefully cared for his
crop in the hopes of a better season.</p>

<p>Alas, his wife died of sorrow, and autumn
brought him nothing but straw. Ostrovsky,
without weeping, dug a grave in the frozen
ground and buried his wife. Then he asked
permission to go to the mines, and borrowed
some money for the trip from his neighbors.
The latter gladly loaned it to him, thinking
thus to get rid of him and to get the profit of
his house and goods. But Ostrovsky fooled
them in their na&iuml;ve simplicity; he heaped up
all of his possessions in his little cottage and
then set fire to it. He no longer thought
of justice; he was nothing but a despairing
man.</p>

<p>The patriarch of the village in which he had
taken refuge tried to recall to him the faith for
which he had been exiled:</p>

<p>"Do you remember," answered Ostrovsky,
"the first visit I paid you to ask for advice?
Ah, so you have forgotten that and you speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
of God.... You are nothing but a crafty
dog! All of you are dogs! There is nothing
here but woods and rocks, and you are all just
as insensible as the very rocks that surround
you.... And your cursed land, and your sky,
and your stars...." "He wanted to say
something more, but he did not dare blaspheme,
and there was silence again in the little cottage...."</p>

<p>This Ostrovsky is among the very best of
Korolenko's heroes. The sight of this despairing
and lonely man, who wanders about in the
Siberian forests with his little daughter, calls
louder for justice than all the speeches in the
world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the wealth of his talent and knowledge,
Korolenko is of tremendous social value
in three fields of work,&mdash;practical affairs,
journalism, and art.</p>

<p>Among the many services which he has rendered
to humanity, let us first mention his
brilliant defence of the half-savage Votiaks,
accused of ritual murder in the famous Malmige
case. Although he had just suffered
great grief himself&mdash;he had lost two children&mdash;he
traveled to a distant town in order to be
at the trial. He took his seat on the bench
of the defenders. He used all of his knowledge,
and all the love in his heart to defend the unhappy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Votiaks, whose acquittal he succeeded in
securing.</p>

<p>As a publicist, he has written some very valuable
articles. Among them are observations on
the famine year (he spent two months in one
of the worst districts). In other articles he
has analyzed a moral malady peculiar to our
state of society:&mdash;honor. In the recent Russian
duels he studied the perverse notions of
honor and the moral changes produced by
sickly egotism. He has studied the causes that
bring about the complete loss of individuality.
Finally, in 1910, he published under the title,
"Present Customs (Notes of a Publicist under
Sentence of Death)" a series of documents
gathered here and there, which constitute an
eloquent and passionate plea in favor of the
abolitionist thesis.</p>

<p>When the great Tolstoy read the preface of
this work, he wrote to Korolenko, "I often
sobbed and wept. Millions of copies of this
work ought to be distributed; it ought to be
read by every one who has a heart. No discourse,
no novel or play, can produce the effect
that your 'Notes' do."</p>

<p>But above all, it is as the pure artist that
Korolenko merits most attention. It is his
talent that has already made him famous, and
it is his talent that will make him immortal in
Russian literature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Korolenko is at present one of the most
popular writers among the educated classes.
They have amply proved this to him, especially
in 1903 and 1908, when they celebrated his
50th birthday and the 30th anniversary of his
literary activity. On the occasion of these
celebrations, delegations from many cities and
universities came to St.&nbsp;Petersburg to congratulate
and to thank the author who, through
so many trials, had never ceased to uphold the
cause of truth and goodness, and to claim for
each human being the right to work, happiness,
and free thought.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br />
VIKENTY VERESSAYEV</h2>


<p>Veressayev is well known in France for his
"Memoirs of a Physician," a work that has
been translated into almost every language.
However, his reputation in Russia is not based
on this book, which is considered his masterpiece,
but rather on his stories and tales. Let
us, however, first take a glance at the life of this
author, a life so closely connected with the subjects
of his works that it forms an indispensable
commentary on them.</p>

<p>Veressayev, whose real name is Vikenty
Smidovich, was born in 1867, in Tula. His
father was a Pole and his mother a Russian.
His father, a very pious and strictly moral man,
was a well known and well liked physician. In
1877, the boy entered the local school and received
his degree there seven years later. In
1884, he left for the University of St.&nbsp;Petersburg,
where he enrolled in the department of
historical sciences. Four years later, when he
was twenty-four and a half, he received his
degree of licentiate of letters.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Most of his
class-mates became school-teachers, but he preferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to pursue his studies. Medicine tempted
him. He left for Zhouriev (formerly Dorpat,
already famous for its department of medicine)
and entered the university, where, at the end of
six years, he received his doctor's degree.</p>

<p>Two years before, in 1892, a cholera epidemic
had broken out in Russia. Young Smidovich,
then a fourth-year student, asked to be sent
immediately to a province in the East, where the
epidemic was spreading like wildfire. He remained
there several months, in fact until the
plague had gone. As a doctor's assistant in an
infirmary organized in one of the mining districts
of the government of Ekaterinoslav, he
witnessed a peasant revolt in which several doctors
were killed and others cruelly burned by
the exasperated and ignorant mob. Veressayev
has traced these sad events with tremendous
power in his story, "Astray."</p>

<p>His doctor's degree in his pocket, he went
to Tula, where he practised for several months,
but soon the position of house-surgeon was
offered to him in the Botkin Hospital in St.&nbsp;Petersburg.
He remained there seven years,
till 1901, when, by order of the Minister of the
Interior, who has charge of all hospital appointments,
he was forced to retire from office
and was expelled from St.&nbsp;Petersburg and forbidden
to reside in either of the two capitals,
Moscow or St.&nbsp;Petersburg. The reason for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was, that the name Veressayev appeared on the
petition of the "intellectuals" which had been
given to the Minister of the Interior, protesting
against the brutal attitude of the police
during a student manifestation in the Kazan
cathedral on March 4, 1901. This petition
brought severe punishment to almost all the
people whose names were signed to it. Veressayev
went abroad; he visited Italy, France,
Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Gifted with poetic inspiration, he had begun
writing at an early age. He was not more than
fourteen when he translated some poems of
Koerner and Goethe into Russian verse. Later,
when at college, he wrote some short prose tales,
which were published in various papers. But it
was in 1896, when the "Russkoe Bogatsvo,"
the large St.&nbsp;Petersburg review, had published
his two important stories, "Astray" and "The
Contagion," that renown came to him. It came
so suddenly that it troubled him and was almost
a blow to his modesty, which is one of the sympathetic
traits of his personality.</p>

<p>In fact, there came a time when the attention
of the literary world, especially among the
younger generation, became so wrapped up in
his works that Gorky and Tchekoff sank to a
second level. This enthusiasm was caused by
the fact that Veressayev's works answered a
general need. They brought into the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of literature a series of characters who summed
up the rising fermentation of new ideas and
seemed to be spokesmen, around whom the
Russian revolutionary forces gathered,&mdash;forces
which, up to this time, had been scattered.
An era of struggle for liberty began.</p>

<p>It is rather important, I think, for the
proper understanding of this period to say a
few words concerning its history.</p>

<p>The struggle of the younger generation
against the autocracy began about 1860, at
the time of the freeing of the serfs, a period
known in Russia as the "epoch of great reforms."
These ameliorations, which extended
into almost every domain of Russian life, left
intact the autocracy, which, under pretence of
protecting itself, fought successfully against
all activity and thus brought about, among the
younger generation, a general movement
towards freedom and socialism. But the autocracy
found its best help in the ignorance of
the people. Urban commerce, little developed
at that time, practically interested only the
peasants&mdash;which means nine-tenths of the
population of Russia. It was natural, then,
that the peasants should become the principal
object of the revolutionary propaganda, and
that tremendous efforts should be made on all
sides in order to awaken them from their dangerous
sleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The peasant uprisings in the history of
Russia, especially the two revolts directed by
Stepan Razin in the 17th century, and Pugachev
in the 18th, proved the fact that the
masses could unite in a general insurrection.
This time, the "intellectuals" joined. As they
advocated a sort of communism, periodic redivisions
of land according to the growth of
the population, and as they harped on the
tradition that land was a gift of God which
no one had a right to own, we can easily see
that the agricultural proletariat would welcome
with open arms the socialistic ideas.</p>

<p>Although this popular movement did not
affect many people, it was attacked with such
pitiless cruelty, that the revolutionists decided
to have recourse to the red terror in order to
fight the white terror which was cutting down
their ranks. The secret goal of this movement
was to replace the autocratic r&eacute;gime with
political institutions emanating from the will
of the people. In order to accomplish its reforms
more quickly, this party, which called
itself the "Popular Will," incited several attempts
at murder; Russia then witnessed dynamite
outrages against imperial trains and
palaces, and finally, the assassination of the
Emperor Alexander II. For a moment the autocratic
r&eacute;gime seemed to totter under these
sudden and fierce blows, but it soon recovered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
The white terror proved to be stronger than
the red. Many executions and banishments
helped to crush the partisans of the "Popular
Will;" then, when the movement had been
checked, the authorities began to repress even
the slightest desire for independence on the
part of the press, the universities, or any other
institutions which could do good to the people.
Dejection and disillusion dominated this period
from 1880 to 1900, which has been so faithfully
portrayed in the works of Tchekoff.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that their
ideals had come to nought, those of the red
terror had not disappeared, and hope remained
in their breasts.</p>

<p>Tchekoff was still living when new symptoms
of fermentation appeared in Russia, and he
could have alluded to this in his later works.
But he did not have a fighting nature, and, in
his solitude, he looked at conditions with
melancholy scepticism. There was need of a
man, a writer&mdash;like Gorky several years later&mdash;born
right in the midst of this movement,
who would be the very product of it, and for
whom its ideas would be a reason for existence.</p>

<p>Veressayev was this man and writer, and it
is as much by his political opinions as by his
literary talents that he gained such a wide-spread
reputation. If his works are not always
irreproachable from a literary standpoint,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
they are always accurate in describing exactly
what the author himself has seen and lived
through.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Veressayev, in three great stories, gives us
the three phases of the movement between 1880
and 1900. These three stories, "Astray,"
"The Contagion" and "At the Turn," are of
such extreme importance, that in the following
pages there will be a detailed analysis of each
of them.</p>

<p>The two protagonists of the story, "Astray,"
are Dr.&nbsp;Chekanhov and his cousin Natasha. The
former is at the end of his moral life, the latter
is on the threshold, and both of them are
"astray," because the one has not found the
road on which to travel through life, and the
other is just beginning to look for it. The
entire existence of Chekanhov is dominated by
the idea that it is <i>his duty to serve the people</i>,
which was the basis of the activity of the
"narodnikis." According to him, the "intellectuals,"
who represent a small and privileged
fraction of the population, are the debtors of
the people and ought to pay their debt by giving
the people knowledge and comfort. This
theory is burned into his very soul; it is the
leading thought that directs all of his actions.
At this epoch, few men showed such absolute
devotion. From 1880 to 1890, after the cruel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
suppression of the movement of the "narodnikis,"
there was a stop in this revolutionary
activity. Unaware of this pacification, Chekanhov
makes great exertions; as a doctor, he combats
disease and saves several people. But how
exhaust the source of this evil, this misery,
which is increased by a despotic social order?
Chekanhov spends his energy in vain; where
else shall he apply his strength?</p>

<p>The famine of 1891! Dr.&nbsp;Chekanhov speaks
only of his despair: "A terrible malady beats
down on one after another of the inhabitants;
it is an epidemic of typhoid caused by the privations
which left us numb and weak." In 1892
an epidemic of cholera broke out. In spite of
the prayers of his parents, the young man
rushes off to the most infected district. One
day, he penetrates into an infected hovel. The
children are sprawling everywhere, the mother
is foolish and stupid, and the father, weakened
by prison labor, has come down with cholera.
The wife forbids the doctor, whom she accuses
of poisoning the sick, to approach her husband.
Scorning the danger, in order to encourage the
sick man, the doctor drinks out of the very cup
which the invalid has used. Nothing counts
with him as long as he can inspire confidence
and save people from death.</p>

<p>"What good is there in love between good
and strong people," adds Chekanhov, after having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
noted down this cure in his "Journal,"
"since it results only in miserable abortions?
And why are the people held down to work which
is so rough and unpleasant? What motive supports
them in their painful labor? Is it the
desire to preserve their infected hovels?"</p>

<p>At the end of these reflections could not
Chekanhov, absolutely in despair, have abandoned
his task? No, he knew how to keep up
his devotion. Sacrificing his life for others,
Chekanhov begins to love life again. He says
to himself: "Life is good ... but will it be
for a long time?" We do not catch the answer.</p>

<p>Furious voices are heard, and a savage and
cruel mob calls him a poisoner and hurls itself
upon him, beating and striking him.</p>

<p>Exhausted by the blows and jeered at by
those whom he had considered his brothers in
need and for whom he had put himself in constant
peril, he lies stretched out on his bed,
suffering severely; but he nourishes no grudge
against his tormentors; on the contrary, his
apostle-like character is moved with pity at the
thought of these uncultured and ignorant beings
so unconscious of the evil that they are
doing. And several days before his death he
writes the following tragic words in his "Journal,"
almost terrifying in their simplicity:</p>

<p>"They have beaten me! They have beaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
me like a mad dog because I came to help them
and because I used all my knowledge and
strength, in one word, gave all that I had. I
am not thinking now about how much I loved
these people and how badly I feel at the way
they have treated me. I simply did not succeed
in gaining their confidence; I did succeed in
making them believe in me for a while, but soon
a mere trifle was enough to plunge them back
among their dark shadows and to awaken in
them an elemental, brutal instinct. And now I
have to die. I am not afraid of death, but of a
tarnished life full of empty remorse. Why have
I struggled? In the name of what am I going
to die? I am only a poor victim stripped of
the strength of an ideal and cared for by no
one.... It had to be so, for we were always
strangers to them, beings belonging to another
world; we scornfully avoid them, without trying
to know them, and a terrible abyss separates
us from them."</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how Chekanhov is
regarded by the new generation and especially
by the woman he loves, his cousin Natasha.
She believes in him, she expects a gospel of life
from him; but Chekanhov cannot respond to
her; he adheres to such vague expressions as:
"work," "idea," "duty towards the people."
He says to her: "You want an idea which will
dominate you entirely and which will lead you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to a definite goal; you want me to give you a
standard and say: 'Fight and die for it.' I
have read more than you, I have had more
experience than you, but like you, <i>I Do Not
Know</i>, and that is our torture." According
to Chekanhov, all of his generation are in the
same position: it is <i>Astray</i>, without a guiding
star, it is perishing without realizing it....
Finally, in order to avoid the pressing questions
of Natasha, who would like to work and sacrifice
herself for the poor, he points out to her the
salutary work of the village school-mistress.
A few days later he dies, welcoming death with
joy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the people who were ending their existence
and those who were beginning it were so
carefully looking for a field of action, the uncultivated
ground of Russian life was gradually
being cleared by the slow evolution of an
economic movement. Between 1895 and 1900,
as a result of the natural development of national
commerce, the number of city workingmen
grew to vast proportions and they formed
an important class, which, on account of its
situation, was much more qualified than the
peasants to interest itself in the ideas of socialism
and liberty. So from the very midst of
the people certain individuals appeared capable
of adopting progressive ideas; Marxism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
awaited them, the theory which is the basis of
European democratic socialism. This doctrine
was nothing new in Russia. But formerly,
the proletariat of the cities had been very little
developed and the Marxian doctrines had been
of theoretical interest only.</p>

<p>"The Contagion" has for its heroine
Natasha,&mdash;the Natasha that we have already
met, but how transformed! She has at last
found her bearings. If, in 1892, she was waiting
for the right road to be shown to her, in
1896 she was enthusiastically following the new
road opened by the doctrines of Marx.</p>

<p>In Zharoshenko's famous picture, "The
Student," Uspensky notes something new in
this type of femininity. He calls it "the masculine
trait"; it is the mark of thought. He
sees there the harmonious fusion of a young
girl and an adolescent boy, with an expression
neither feminine nor masculine, but exceptionally
human. And this transforms Zharoshenko's
"Student" into a luminous personification,
unknown up to this time, a type which
synthesizes "le type humain."</p>

<p>In the work of Veressayev this student is
Natasha. Reflection has ripened her mind since
her last talk with poor Chekanhov. She has
become a regular "mannish woman," having
seen and thought a great deal. She has traveled;
she has lived in St.&nbsp;Petersburg and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
south of Russia. Full of courage and energy,
she claims to be fully satisfied with her lot; she
begs her companions to follow the road she has
found, and when they refuse she becomes angry
with them. In company with her comrade
Dayev she vigorously attacks the convictions
of the men of Kisselev, who see sufficient safety
in the workingmen's associations; she rises
up, in the name of Marxism, against the
"narodnikis," whom she considers ingenuous
idealists; she refuses to endorse the theories
of the "intellectuals," who oppose the thought
of any great work, since they believe that
smaller deeds are more immediately realizable.
When one of them, a doctor, Tro&iuml;tsky, ends
his conversation with her with these words:
"It is not necessary to wear one's brains out
trying to solve difficult problems while there is
so much immediate need and so few workers,"
she puts an end to the discussion. Shrugging
her shoulders, in a trembling voice she answers:
"How can you live and think as you do? New
problems confront us, and you stand before
them and do nothing, because you have lost
confidence. I can't work any longer with you,
because it would mean dedicating myself blindly
to 'spiritual death.'"</p>

<p>Veressayev does not show us how she solves
the problems of which she speaks. The adepts
of this sort of social apostleship usually propagate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
their ideas among the workingmen, help
them, and play a part in conspiracies. Natasha
offers herself up. But the censorship has not
allowed Veressayev to carry his subject on, and
he has limited himself to showing us Natasha
in company with her friends and disciples, giving
herself up to oratorical tilts, discussing
principles, and uttering long discourses full of
passion, faith, and juvenile impatience,&mdash;discourses
which unfortunately are mistaken in
their reasoning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In realizing from the socialist ideal the logical
and inevitable consequence of capitalism,
which continues according to a law independent
of human will, the Marxian doctrine dissipates
the doubts and consolidates the faith of those
who adopt it. According to this faith, the
socialists do not have to create socialism, they
only have to co&ouml;perate in the historical process
which will inevitably make socialism grow. In
thus recognizing the supremity of the law of
history, socialism, utopian up to this time, becomes
scientific and, under its new form, it is
no longer subject to the influence of personal
opinions, no matter how full of genius they
may be. But this "scientific socialism," which,
on account of the backwardness of political
economy, could be only a step ahead, was taken
by the younger generation of Russia as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
"dernier mot" of the science. The result was,
that several narrow and exclusive dogmas were
grafted on this doctrine. Thus, the theory of
"class struggle" transformed itself into the
absolute negation of all community interests
between the diverse social strata. The "materialistic"&mdash;or
rather "economic"&mdash;point of
view, according to which the products of spiritual
activity in the history of humanity lose all
independence, being only the consequences of
economic organization, generated scorn for all
idealism; and the proletariat character of
the socialistic movement impelled society to
divide into two hostile and irreconcilable parts,
one of which is made up of the proletariats, the
other of the elements opposed to socialism. To
this last party the enormous mass of half-starved
peasants joined itself. The peasants,
according to the Marxian doctrine, cannot understand
socialism until they have become proletariats
themselves, instead of becoming miserable
landed proprietors. And this "proletariazation"
of about 100,000,000 peasants, the
fervent Marxists consider a fatal and desirable
event in the near future.</p>

<p>These theories, carried to excess, were sure
to excite a reaction. It manifested itself by a
neo-idealistic movement, which found the principal
cause of social progress in the tendency
of humanity to attain supreme development and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
perfection. Then there were the "narodnikis"
who considered the "proletariazation" of the
Russian peasant impossible and inopportune.
There were also the various groups of Socialists
who applauded the criticism that Bernstein
made on the Marxian orthodoxy. So several
deviations were made from the original theory;
there were grave dissensions and interminable
and bitter controversies. All this occupies a
large part of "At the Turn," one of Veressayev's
novels, in which these events are traced
with almost stenographic exactitude.</p>

<p>The characters are, Tanya, a fanatic Marxist;
her brother, Tokarev, whose soul is a field
for spiritual battles; and Varenka, a village
school-mistress. There are several eccentric
characters around them, such as Serge, a young
apostle of a somewhat Nietzschean egoism, Antsov
and others. Tanya is none other than
Natasha of "Astray," with this great difference,
however, that Tanya has found truth already
formulated for her, and does not have
to grope about for it. Nevertheless, the essential
characteristics of the two girls are the same.
They both have the same joyous self-denial, the
same love of life, the same courage in face of
difficulties, and also the same faith in a better
future. Tanya has lived during the whole winter
with her comrades in a region devastated
by the famine, and she has spent there all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
she possesses. At Toliminsk, where she arrives
after a long walk, she speaks of her meagre living
and tells amusing stories without suspecting
her wonderful heroism.</p>

<p>But this young girl, full of the joy of life
and ready for any sacrifices, is pitiless towards
her theoretical adversaries and has absolutely
no compassion for them. The passage in
"Crime and Punishment," in which Dostoyevsky
depicts one of his heroes in the following
manner: "He was young, he had abstract ideas,
and was, consequently, cruel," perfectly fits
Tanya. Veressayev tells the following incident:
"One day, when she was at the station, some
peasants rushed down from the platform. A
railroad guard struck one of the peasants.
The peasant put his head down and ran off....
Tanya, knitting her brows, said: 'That's good
for him! Oh, these peasants!' And her eyes
lighted up with scorn and hate...."</p>

<p>Just as Tanya brings Natasha to our mind,
so does Varenka make us think of Dr.&nbsp;Chekanhov;
the same feeling of duty governs them
both. But, while Chekanhov wanted to devote
himself to the social problem, without ever succeeding
in doing so, because he did not exactly
see the principles, Varenka was able to devote
herself to her work without mental reservation.
However, she refuses to, because she has not
enough enthusiasm for this sort of research.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Her understanding, which is deeper and
broader than Tanya's, sees the error, the narrowness
of her doctrine; she cannot admit it,
and, fired by a desire to devote herself body and
soul to some useful work, she chooses the laborious
profession of a school-mistress in the
village. But this humble and unpleasant career
does not satisfy her. Little by little ennui and
anguish drive her to suicide.</p>

<p>Between Tokarev, Tanya's brother, and
Varenka, the contrast is complete. While still
a student, he had accepted, with all the ardor
of youth, the idea of duty, and he desired to
give himself up to the cause of justice and
truth; but, having encountered many obstacles,
he felt, when he had reached his thirtieth year,
that the sacred fire was going out.</p>

<p>He now dreamed only of his personal happiness,
and of poor theories that justified this
egoism. An assured material existence, comfort,
a happy domestic life, work without risks,
without sacrifices, but useful enough in appearance
to satisfy the conscience, attracted him irresistibly.
He then went to work to tear out
his former ideas, which had taken a pretty firm
root. Urged on by his conscience, which protested,
he forced himself at times to resurrect
his youthful enthusiasm; he thought a great
deal about morals, about duty, and he read
many books treating this subject; he says: "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
feel that something extremely necessary has left
me. My feelings about humanity have disappeared
and nothing can replace them. I read
a great deal now, and I am directing my
thoughts towards ethics. I try to give morality
a solid basis and I try to make clearer to myself
the various categories of duty.... And I
blush to pronounce the word, 'Duty.'"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Tokarev tries, at times, to justify
his inclinations towards peaceable bourgeois
prosperity to the struggling youth who
surround his sister Tanya. These cruel young
people, however, answer him only with sarcastic
remarks, and caustic arguments, and do not
hesitate to express their doubts as to the sincerity
of his opinions. To his conscience, they
are like a living reproach from the past. Once
he also was intolerant towards others as these
people are towards him to-day. And that is
why he suffers under their condemnation of
him. He defends himself weakly, and after one
of his oratorical tilts, he falls into such spiritual
depression, that he almost thinks of suicide.</p>

<p>These, then, are the three main characters of
Veressayev's novel. In the background we have
the secondary characters. We have the proud
proprietor and his wife, both of them liberals;
we have the pedagogue Osmerkov, who does not
like talented people because they bother everybody;
and then there are the respectable inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of Gniezdelovka, Serge's father and
mother, who are entirely absorbed with their
household and with cards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The Comrades" is a variation on this
theme: old school friends, who formerly had
been wrapped up in a great ideal, are now
living a life of shabby prosperity, and they
feel that they have deteriorated, although they
do not dare to confess it to each other.</p>

<p>And Veressayev profits by this to generalize
on the causes of this fatal fall after the unselfish
enthusiasms of youth. He sees them especially
in a mysterious force: "The Invisible," already
studied by Maeterlinck, Ibsen, Tchekoff, and
especially by de Maupassant; and he sees them
in the unhappy conditions of Russian history,
which created a social and political organization
favorable only to those who crawl along
and not to those who plan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now analyze the stories in which
Veressayev describes the life of the people.</p>

<p>The story of "The Steppe" is as follows:
One beautiful autumn evening two men meet on
the steppe. One of them, the forger Nikita, is
returning to his native land; he is wounded in
the leg and it is hard for him to walk. He is
looking for work. The other is a professional
beggar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The beggar, who is never hungry because he
has no scruples, offers Nikita something to eat.
After resting a short while, the travelers continue
on their way. In the first village that
they come to, the pilgrim beggar makes a
speech to the inhabitants and sells them certain
"sacred properties" which he keeps in his bag.
After pocketing gifts of money and various
other things, the false pilgrim pursues his way,
still accompanied by Nikita. On the road once
more, he offers to share with his comrade the
fruits of his "work," but the latter refuses.</p>

<p>"What a fool!" cries the beggar, and bursts
out laughing. But Nikita, indignant, gives
him a heavy blow and leaves him for good.</p>

<p>"For a Home" and "In Haste" gave
Veressayev an opportunity to note one of the
characteristic traits of the ambitious villagers:
their strong desire to preserve their homes and
to propagate the race.</p>

<p>In the first of these stories, two old people,
Athanasius and his wife, want to marry their
daughter Dunka, but the "mir,"&mdash;the assembly
of peasants,&mdash;egotistical and inflexible
towards people who are growing weak, oppose
them. "We have not enough land for our own
children," is the answer of the "mir." Dunka
remains unmarried, and dies at an early age.
Her mother soon follows her. Old Athanasius
lives alone in his freezing "isba," which is in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
state of ruin, while the neighboring isbas, solid
and austere, "spitefully watch him die."</p>

<p>In the last story, we have a widower who is
the father of five children, and is therefore
looking everywhere for a woman with some
bodily defect, because he knows that other
women will not want to have anything to do
with him.</p>

<p>It is the same wish to preserve his home that
makes a peasant go to the city to earn his
living while he leaves his family in the country
to take care of the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The peasant is, besides, entirely engrossed
with the difficulties of existence. Necessity
often urges him to desperate acts.... Some,
who are almost starving, ingratiate themselves
with the raftsmen. They force wages down by
asking only 5 copecks (5 cents) a day....
If they are contented with this absurd pay, it
is because they avoid seeing how their little
children are suffering at home. "It's hard
living at present; there is not enough space;
ground is scarce and there are too many
people." "Men haven't room enough," says a
sad-looking man with prominent cheek-bones.
"But," he goes on, "they tell me that sickness
has struck our village, and that the men are
losing blood! Is that true?" "Yes, it's true!"
"So much the better! That will clean out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
people; it will be easier to live then," he concludes,
thoughtfully. (From "In the Cold
Spell.")</p>

<p>In almost all the work of Veressayev a voice
proclaims that the Russian peasant is near his
end; that he is not useful to any one. The
poverty of the villages is painted in the most
sombre colors. The people are unanimous in
believing that the struggle for life has become
terrible. "On what will you live?" one asks
the other. "The earth does not nourish us.
The holdings are small; in summer, one must
cultivate, and in winter the cottages have to
be closed while we look for work or charity.
What is there to eat? Hay! Let us thank God
that the cattle have enough of that. Oats? We
have to give four hectoliters and two measures
of our oats to the common granary.... And
taxes and clothes? coal-oil, matches, tea,
sugar? Tell me, how can one live?"</p>

<p>The unfortunates even go so far as to bless
war and epidemics. "Everything went better
then. Men lived peacefully in the fear of God,
the Lord took care of every one. War, smallpox,
famine came and cleaned out the populace;
those that remained, after having got the
coffins ready, lived easier. God pitied us. Now
there is no more war; He leaves us to our own
poor devices."</p>

<p>Speeches like this abound in the works of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Veressayev. A dull sadness, bordering on
despair, breathes forth from the pages. It
seems, at times, as if the Russian peasant could
never awake from his torpor, because the author
represents him as full of infinite egoism,
without any spirit of solidarity, sacrificing
everything for love of his sorry little house
and his morsel of ground, which is insufficient
to nourish him. But we must remember that
the Marxian point of view, which the author
takes, explains in part the horror of such pictures.</p>

<p>According to Veressayev the poor peasants
can better their position only by getting
rid of their land, in order to become free
proletarians. But if the peasant class is unfortunate,
it is so, for the most part, because it is
the most exploited and the most oppressed. It
is not, then, the getting rid of their land that
will bring the peasants salvation; on the contrary,
they must fight for it against their oppressors.
The peasants are beginning to understand
the necessity of this struggle, and
their late uprisings in several provinces have
shown that they lack neither solidarity nor organization.</p>

<p>In the story called, "The End of Andrey
Ivanovich," which is about the working class of
Russia, we see the transformation of a peasant
into a "city man." In his new surroundings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
it is true, the wine-shop plays an important
r&ocirc;le, but schools are organized there which inspire
a taste for reading, and "thought"
gradually awakens.</p>

<p>Andrey has not yet rid himself of his rustic
unsociability; however, he is beginning to become
civilized, and is receiving city culture.
He tries to free himself from his misery, from
his degradation. He beats his wife when he
is drunk, but, at the same time, he gets angry
at a friend when he beats his mistress....
According to his own confession he reads many
useless things, nevertheless he can become interested
in a serious work. If he drinks to
excess, it is to "drive away the thoughts" that
torment him. He wants to analyze every question
and find out what is at the bottom of it.
He is the spiritual brother of Natasha, Chekanhov,
and Tanya.</p>

<p>The sequel to this story is "The Straight
Road." This time we are transported into the
world of factory workers, a world lamentable
for its misery, despair, and crime. Andrey
Ivanovich's wife, Alexandra Mikhailovna, being
without resources after the death of her
husband, with a little daughter in arms, enters
a book-binding establishment, belonging to a
man named Semidalov. But the foreman, a
vicious and evil-minded man, reigns as despot.
It is he who gives out the work. The young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
girls who listen to his advances are sure of
being shown partiality; the others are badly
treated. As Alexandra wants to live honestly,
her work in the shop is made very hard. Her
best friend, Tanya, who inadvertently spilled
oil on some paper and could not pay for the
damage, had to give herself to the foreman.
Finally Tanya despairs and ends by drowning
herself. Alexandra is saved, thanks to a "loveless"
marriage with the locksmith, Lestmann.
She accepts this union so that she will not have
to starve and can remain "straight." Thus,
the "straight road" which Alexandra wanted
to follow has forced her finally to sell herself,
to marry a man whom she does not love.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each page of Veressayev's work exists
merely to throw light on this or that social
question, considered from a well defined point
of view. The secret of his success rests mostly
in the frank, sincere manner in which he has
approached certain problems. At the same
time, all of his work breathes forth a deep and
tender love for those who suffer. In reality,
there is not a single book by Veressayev which
might not be a confession; all that he writes
he has already experienced himself, and his
work vibrates with a delicate and personal emotion.
It is only necessary to read "The Memoirs
of a Physician," which is almost an autobiography,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in order to perceive the moral relationship
that exists between Veressayev and the
heroes of his stories.</p>

<p>This book is the confession of a physician
from the time of his early studies. The young
man is <a class="corr" name="TC_1" id="TC_1" title="astonishd">astonished</a> at the number of maladies
that exist and by the unbelievable variety of
keen suffering that nature inflicts upon the
human species, man. Soon he is obliged to
make a discovery that stuns him: that medicine
is incapable of curing many evils. It only
gropes about, trying thousands of remedies before
it arrives at a sure result. The scruples
and anxiety of the student increase, especially
after an autopsy on a woman in the amphitheatre,
when the professor announces that the
woman has succumbed because the surgeon, who
was operating, swooned, and ends by saying:
"In such difficult operations the very best surgeons
are not safe from accidents of this kind."
After this, the professor shook hands with his
colleague and every one left. At that time,
doubt entered the mind of the young man. And
so, within a period of ten years, he passes from
extreme optimism to the same degree of pessimism.</p>

<p>We follow him in the hospitals, where he is
scandalized by the brutality of the teaching,
which makes use of the unwilling bodies of sick
people. "Not being able to pay for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
treatment in money, they have to pay with
their bodies." Finally, the student becomes a
doctor himself. Full of faith and knowledge,
he starts practice in a small market-town of
central Russia. But his work soon cools him
down; in the clinic he had studied mostly exceptional
cases; now he is disconcerted by
simple and every-day sicknesses. His ignorance
leads to the following tragic case:</p>

<p>One day, a poor and widowed washerwoman
brings him her sick child, whom she does not
want to take to the hospital because her two
oldest children died there. The child is a weak
boy of eight years who has caught scarlet-fever.
At first, the inside of the throat begins
to swell, and, to prevent an abscess, the doctor
orders rubbings with a mercurial ointment.
The next day, he finds the boy all aquiver and
covered with pimples. "There is no mistake,"
he says, "the rubbing has spread the infection
into the neighboring organs and a general
poisoning of the blood has taken place. The
little boy is lost.... All that day and night
I wandered about the streets. I could think of
nothing, and I felt crushed by the horror of the
thing. Only at times this thought came into
my mind: 'I have killed a human being!'"
The child lived ten days more. The night before
his death Veressayev comes to see him.
The poor mother is sobbing in a corner of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
miserable room. She pulls herself together,
however, and taking three rubles out of her
pocket, offers them to the trembling doctor,
who refuses them. Then this woman falls down
on her knees and thanks him for having pitied
her son. "I'll leave everything, I'll give up
everything," sobs the doctor.... "I have
decided to leave for St.&nbsp;Petersburg to-morrow
in order to study some more even if I die of
hunger!"</p>

<p>Once the resolution was made to pursue his
studies in a more practical manner, he becomes
the house-surgeon of a hospital. But even
there a mass of problems disturb him. He sees
how dangerous the simplest operations are; he
is frightened by the unrestraint of the doctors,
who try new methods on the sick, methods the
effects of which are not known, methods that
result in the patient's being inoculated with
more sickness. Medicine cannot progress without
direct experimentation, and experience is
gained at the expense of the more unfortunate.
Nevertheless, Veressayev does not argue
against this way of working; he shows the
facts, and leaves it to the reader to decide. On
the other hand, he does not hide his fear of the
common ignorance of all doctors. Every individual
differs from his neighbor. How distinguish
their idiosyncrasies? Once the scope
of a sickness is known, what remedy shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
used? Some say this, others, that. How shall
one choose? Veressayev has felt all of this;
he has tried to harden himself against the unreasonable
ingratitude of some, the scepticism
of others; he realizes that patience, resignation,
and heroism are needed in order to struggle
against and support the mortifications in
the career of a doctor. How much easier it
would be not to consider medicine as infallible;
to study it as an art rather than as a science.
But people prefer to believe that doctors know
everything. They do not want to see the reality,
and this is the reason why sad, and at times
tragic conflicts arise between patient and
physician.</p>

<p>Finally, what could the most perfect medical
science and the cleverest doctor do against the
enormous mass of sickness and suffering that
are the inevitable result of the social evils, of
which poverty is the most conspicuous? How
can one tell a man that his trade is running
him down and that he does not get enough
nourishment? How can one order a man to
eat better food, to get more sleep and more
pure air? First, and most important, is the
necessity of curing the social organism.</p>

<p>It is easy to see why this book made many
enemies for its author. There is too much
frankness and conscientiousness in these
studies not to anger those who have their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
greatest interest in concealing the truth! The
upright man who sees primarily in medicine a
means to relieve human suffering, cannot realize
without sadness the many abuses hidden under
the name of this science.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"In the War," recently published, is the
story of Veressayev's campaign in Manchuria.
In this work, the author has painted vividly
the peregrinations of his moving hospital, and
also the terrible sufferings of the Russian army.
By the thousands, the starved children of the
campaign, the Russian foot-soldiers, stoics and
fatalists, sacrificing their lives for a strange
and incomprehensible cause, pass before the
eyes of the reader. And in the background,
detaching themselves from the crowd, in their
gold and silver embroidered uniforms, are "the
heroes of the war, these vultures of the advance
and rear-guard, who enrich themselves at the
expense of the unfortunate soldiers." A number
of these great chiefs, whose infamy was
evident at the end of the war, since they had
shown themselves incapable of dealing with the
foreign enemy, had distinguished themselves by
the ferocity they exhibited in quelling internal
troubles. As to the military doctors, the
greater number of them went into the campaign
only for commercial gain. Among the
nurses who accompanied them, aside from those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
who were real heroines of goodness and devotion,
there were many who prostituted themselves
shamefully.</p>

<p>Corruption, carelessness, disorder, and cowardice
are shown on every page of this story,
as well as the terrible suffering endured by
the wounded in the hospitals. The wounded
were the real martyrs of this frightful campaign.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Veressayev, like all of his heroes and heroines,
wants to help the people, and for this reason
he gets in touch with the revolutionists who
consecrate their work to political and social
regeneration, under the various titles, "narodnikis,"
Marxists, Socialists, idealists and so on....
Which of these does he prefer? We do
not know. We find the influence of Marx in
his ideas, but we cannot affirm that he is an absolute
Marxian. It seems as if Veressayev,
troubled by the innumerable divergencies of
opinion, asks himself secretly: "Will this war
lead to the unity of opinion and program, so
necessary for victory, or by its quarrels will it
only retard the harmony so much sought
after?"</p>

<p>It is not discussion that will finally lead to
unity, but rather life itself, with all its realities.</p>

<p>It would be most interesting to read a sequel
to the three famous novels of Veressayev&mdash;"Astray,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"The Contagion," and "At the
Turning"&mdash;in which he would give us the
psychology of his former heroes under present
conditions. To-day, the people are not
"astray"; the field is big enough for every
one to find the place that best suits his ideas,
tastes, and temperament. Dr.&nbsp;Chekanhov, if he
were living now, instead of being maltreated by
the people, would certainly be their well beloved
champion, and perhaps represent them in the
Duma; the timid Tokarev, in spite of his aversion
to the ideas of the revolutionists, could
find a place in the liberal party of the Reforming
Democrats, or at least among the Octobrists;
the unfortunate Varenka would not be
worn out by her work as school-mistress, for
she would be supported by the peasants. The
peasants themselves are not the miserable and
resigned creatures of Veressayev's earlier
stories. Certainly, liberty is not yet a legal
thing in Russia, and the Duma is still an unstable
institution, but the end of absolutism is
near, for a great event has taken place in the
empire of the Tsar, namely, this awakening of
the feeling of human dignity, and the spirit of
revolt among the lower strata of the Russian
people, which in the past, by its unconsciousness,
formed the granite pedestal of autocracy.
The struggle is terrible, but confidence in final
victory redoubles the energy of the strugglers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
A certain Russian was right when he said:
"Formerly, life was formidable, but now it is
both formidable and gay."</p>

<p>In reading the works of Veressayev, Tchekoff,
and other painters of modern Russian
society, it is easy to note that not one of
them anticipated this sudden change of scenery
on the Russian political stage, a change which,
however, was being prepared in the souls of the
peasants. But let us not reproach them!
Russia will always remain an enigma.</p>

<p>There is a very old story about the son of
the peasant Ilya Murometz. After remaining
lazily resting in his "isba" for thirty years, he
suddenly arose, and began to walk with such
fury that the earth trembled. How could these
writers conceive the time when this lazy giant
would make up his mind to walk? It is enough
to have the assurance that now, no matter what
happens, since he <i>has</i> arisen, he will not lie
down again.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br />
MAXIM GORKY</h2>


<p>Maxim Gorky is the most original and, after
Tolstoy, the most talented of modern Russian
writers. He was born in 1868 or 1869&mdash;he
does not know exactly when himself&mdash;in a
dyer's back shop at Nizhny Novgorod. His
mother, Barbara Kashirina, was the daughter of
the aforementioned dyer; and his father,
Maxim Pyeshkov, was an upholsterer. The
child was christened Alexis. His real name,
then, is Alexis Pyeshkov, and Maxim Gorky<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
is only his pseudonym. When he was four, he
lost his father, and three years later, his mother.
He was then taken by his grandfather, who had
been a soldier under Nicholas I, a hard, authoritative,
pitiless old man, before whom all
trembled. And it was under his rude tutelage
that the child first began to read. When he was
nine, he was sent to work for a shoemaker, an
evil sort of man who maltreated him.</p>

<p>"One day," Gorky tells us, "I was warming
some water for him; the bowl fell, and I burned
my hands badly. That evening I ran away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
my grandfather having scolded me severely. I
then became a painter's apprentice."</p>

<p>He did not remain long in this position.
From this time on, his unsatisfied soul was
seized with the "wanderlust." First apprenticed
to an engraver, and then as a gardener,
he finally became a scullion on one of the boats
that plies up and down the Volga. Here he felt
more at ease.</p>

<p>On board, in the person of the master-cook,
named Smoury, he unexpectedly met a teacher.
This cook, who had been a soldier, loved to read,
and he gave the child all the books that he had
in an old trunk. They consisted of the works
of Gogol, Dumas' novels, the "Lives of the
Saints," a manual of geography, and some
popular novels. Surely, a queer collection!</p>

<p>Smoury inspired his scullion, then sixteen
years of age, "with an ardent curiosity for the
printed word." A "furious" desire to learn
seized the young fellow; he went to Kazan, a
university city, in the hope of "learning gratuitously
all sorts of beautiful things." Cruel
deception! They explained to him that "this
was not according to the established order."
Discouraged, a few months later, he took a
position with a baker. He who dreamed of the
sun and the open air had to be imprisoned in a
filthy and damp cellar. He remained there for
two years, earning two dollars a month, board
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and lodging included; the food, however, was
putrid, and his lodging consisted of an attic
which he shared with five other men.</p>

<p>"My life in that bakery," he has said, "left
a bitter impression. Those two years were the
hardest of my whole life." He has thus described
his recollections in one of his stories:</p>

<p>"We lived in a wooden box, under a low and
heavy ceiling, all covered with cobwebs and permeated
with fine soot. Night pressed us between
the two walls, spattered with spots of mud and
all mouldy. We got up at five in the morning
and, stupid and indifferent, began work at six
o'clock. We made bread out of the dough
which our comrades had prepared while we
slept. The whole day, from dawn till ten at
night, some of us sat at the table rolling out
the dough, and, to avoid becoming torpid, we
would constantly rock ourselves to and fro while
the others kneaded in the flour. The enormous
oven, which resembled a fantastic beast, opened
its large jaws, full of dazzling flames, and
breathed forth upon us its hot breath, while its
two black and enormous cavities watched our
unending work....</p>

<p>"Thus, from one day to the next, in the
floury dust, in the mud that our feet brought in
from the yard, in the suffocating and terrible
heat, we rolled out the dough and made cracknels,
moistening them with our sweat; we hated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
our work with an implacable hatred; we never
ate what we made, preferring black bread to
these odorous dainties."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this period of his life, he had occasion
to study at first hand certain places where he
received original information which he later used
in writing "Konovalov" and "The Ex-Men,"
which have thus acquired an autobiographical
value. In fact, he worked a long while with
these "ex-men;" like them, he sawed wood,
and carried heavy burdens. At the same time,
he devoted all his spare time to reading and
thinking about problems, which became more
and more "cursed" and alarming. He had
found an attentive listener and interlocutor in
the person of his comrade, the baker Konovalov.
These two men, while baking their bread, found
time to read. And the walls of the cellar heard
the reading of the works of Gogol, Dostoyevsky,
Karamzine, and others. Then they used
to discuss the meaning of life. On holidays,
Gorky and <a class="corr" name="TC_2" id="TC_2" title="Konavolov">Konovalov</a> had for the moment an
opportunity to come out of the hole&mdash;this
word does not exaggerate&mdash;in which they
worked, to breathe the fresh air, to live a bit
in nature's bosom, and to see their fellow men.</p>

<p>"On holidays," Gorky tells us, "we went
with Konovalov down to the river, into the
fields; we took a little brandy and bread with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
us, and, from morning till evening, we were in
the open air."</p>

<p>They often went to an old, abandoned house
which served as a refuge for a whole tribe of
miserable and wandering people, who loved to
tell of their wandering lives. Gorky and his
companion were always well received on account
of the provisions which they distributed so generously.</p>

<p>"Each story spread out before our eyes like
a piece of lace in which the black threads predominated&mdash;they
represented the truth&mdash;and
where there were threads of light color&mdash;they
were the lies. These people loved us in their
way, and were attentive listeners, because I
often read a great deal to them."</p>

<p>Often, these expeditions were not without
their risks. One day, two of the baker's workmen
happened to drown in a bog; another time,
they were taken in a police raid and passed the
night in the station house.</p>

<p>It was also at this time that Gorky frequented
the company of several students, not
care-free and happy ones, but miserable young
fellows like those whom Turgenev described as
"nourished by physical privations and moral
sufferings."</p>

<p>On leaving the bakery, where his health, very
much weakened by the lack of air and by bad
food, did not permit him to remain any longer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
he joined those vagabonds, those wanderers,
whose melancholy companion he had been, and
whose painter and poet he was to be. In their
company, he traveled through Russia in every
sense of the word, now as a longshoreman, now
as a wood-chopper. Whenever he had a copeck
in his pocket he bought books and newspapers
and spent the night reading them. He suffered
hunger and cold; he slept in the open air in
summer, and, in winter, in some refuge or cellar.
The feverish activity of so keen an intellect in
an organism so crushed had, as its consequence,
one of the attempts at suicide which are so
frequent among the younger generation of the
Russians.</p>

<p>In 1889, at the age of twenty-one, Gorky
shot himself in the chest, but he did not succeed
in killing himself. Soon afterwards, he became
gate-keeper for the winter at Tzaratzine;
but the summer had hardly come before he began
his vagabondage again, in the course of
which he undertook a thousand little jobs in
order to keep himself alive. On the road, he
noticed those pariahs whom society does not
want or who do not want society. And of
these, in his short stories, he has created immortal
types.</p>

<p>Life was still very hard for him at this time.
He has given us a moving sketch of it in his
story entitled: "Once in Autumn." The hero,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
who is none other than the author himself,
passes the night under an old, upturned boat,
in the company of a prostitute who is just as
poor and just as abandoned as himself. They
have broken into a booth in order to steal
enough bread to keep them from starving.
Gorky is sad; he wants to weep; but the poor
girl, miserable as she is, consoles him and covers
him with kisses.</p>

<p>"Those were the first kisses any woman ever
gave me, and they were the best, for those that
I received later always cost me a lot and never
gave me any joy.... At this time, I was already
preparing myself to be an active and
powerful force in society; it seemed to me
at times that I had in part accomplished my
purpose.... I dreamed of political resolutions,
of social reorganization; I used to read
such deep and impenetrable authors that their
thoughts did not seem to be a part of them&mdash;and
now a prostitute warmed me with her body,
and I was in debt to a miserable, shameful creature,
banished by a society that did not want
to accord her a place. The wind blew and
groaned, the rain beat down upon the boat, the
waves broke around us, and both of us, closely
entwined, trembled from cold and hunger. And
Natasha consoled me; she spoke to me in a
sweet, caressing voice, as only a woman can.
In listening to her tender and na&iuml;ve words, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
wept, and those tears washed away from my
heart many impurities, much bitterness, sadness
and hatred, all of which had accumulated there
before this night."</p>

<p>At daybreak, they say good-bye to each
other, and never see one another again.</p>

<p>"For more than six months, I looked in all
the dives and dens in the hope of seeing that
dear little Natasha once more, but it was in
vain...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We find him again at Nizhny Novgorod at
the time of the call for military recruits. Gorky
was reformed, for, he says, "They do not
accept those who are fallen." Meanwhile, he
became a kvass merchant and exercised this
trade for several months. Finally, he became
the secretary of a lawyer, named Lanine. The
latter, who had a very good reputation, took a
deep interest in the poor boy whom life had
treated so ill. He became interested in his intellectual
development and, according to Gorky
himself, had a great influence on him. At
Nizhny Novgorod, as at Kazan, Gorky felt himself
attracted by the circle of young people who
discussed the "cursed" questions, and he soon
was noticed by his comrades. They spoke of
him as "a live and energetic soul."</p>

<p>Easy as life was for Gorky in this city, where
he remained for a while, the "wanderlust"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
again seized him. "Not feeling at home among
these intelligent people," he traveled. From
Nizhny Novgorod, he went, in 1893, to Tzaratzine;
then he traveled on foot through the
entire province of the Don, the Ukraine, entered
into Bessarabia, and from there descended
by the coast of the Crimea as far as Kuban.</p>

<p>In October, 1892, Gorky found himself at
Tiflis, where he worked in the railroad shops.
That same year, he published in a local paper
his first story, "Makar Choudra," in which already
a remarkable talent was evident.</p>

<p>Leaving Tiflis after a short sojourn there,
he came to the banks of the Volga, in his native
country, and began to write stories for the
local papers. A happy chance made him meet
Korolenko, who took a great interest in the
"debutante" writer. "In the year 1893-1894,"
writes Gorky, "I made the acquaintance of
Vladimir Korolenko, to whom I owe my introduction
into 'great' literature. He has done
a great deal for me in teaching me many
things."</p>

<p>The important influence of Korolenko on the
literary development of Gorky can best be seen
in one of the latter's letters to his biographer,
Mr. Gorodetsky. "Write this," he says to his
biographer, "write this without changing a
single word: It is Korolenko who taught Gorky
to write, and if Gorky has profited but little by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the teaching of Korolenko, it is the fault of
Gorky alone. Write: Gorky's first teacher was
the soldier-cook Smoury; his second teacher
was the lawyer Lanine; the third, Alexander
Kalouzhny, an 'ex-man;' the fourth, Korolenko...."</p>

<p>From the day when he met Korolenko,
Gorky's stories appeared mostly in the more
important publications. In 1895, he published
"Chelkashe" in the important Petersburg review,
"Russkoe Bogatsvo;" a year later,
other publications equally well known published,
"Konovalov," "Malva," and "Anxiety."
These works brought Gorky into the literary
world, where he soon became one of the favorite
writers. The critics, at first sceptical, soon
joined their voices with the enthusiastic clamor
of the people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gorky's wandering life has given his works
a peculiar and universally established form.
He is, above all others, the poet of the "barefoot
brigade," of the vagabonds who eternally
wander from one end of Russia to the other,
carelessly spending the few pennies that they
have succeeded in earning, and who, like the
birds of the sky, have no cares for the morrow.</p>

<p>But this does not suffice to explain this author's
popularity, especially among the younger
generation. The "barefoot brigade" is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
a novelty in Russian literature. We find it in
the works of Reshetnikov, Uspensky, Mamine,
Zhassinsky, and others. It is true that, up to
this time, the vagabonds had been represented
as the dregs of the people, as hopeless drunkards,
thieves, and murderers. The writers who
represented them were satisfied in rousing in
their readers pity for the victims of this social
disorder, victims so wounded by fate, that they
have not even a realization of the injustice with
which they are treated. And it is only in the
works of the great dramatist Ostrovsky that we
find any happy vagabonds, with a deep love of
nature and beauty.</p>

<p>Gorky's vagabonds have, like Ostrovsky's,
exalted feelings for natural beauties, but they
possess, besides, a full consciousness of themselves,
and they declare open war against
society. Gorky lives the lives of his heroes; he
seems to sink himself into them, and, at the
same time, he idealizes them, and often uses them
as his spokesmen. Far from being crushed by
fate, his vagabonds clothe themselves with a certain
pride in their misery; for them, the ideal
existence is the one they lead, because it is free;
with numerous variations, they all exalt the irresistible
seduction of vagabondage:</p>

<p>"As for me, just listen! How many things
I've seen in my fifty-eight years," says Makar
Choudra. "In what country have I not been?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
That is the only way to live. Walk, walk, and
you see everything. Don't stay long in one
place: what is there out of the ordinary in that?
Just as day and night eternally run after one
another, thus you must run, avoiding daily life,
so that you will not cease to love it...."</p>

<p>"I, brother,"&mdash;says, in turn, Konovalov,&mdash;"I
have decided to go all over the earth, in
every sense of the word. You always see something
new.... You think of nothing....
The wind blows, and you might say that it
blows the dust out of your soul. You feel free
and easy.... You are not troubled by any
one. If you are hungry, you stop, and work
to earn a few pennies; if there is no work to
be had, you ask for some bread and it is given
to you. So you see many countries, and the
most diverse beauties...."</p>

<p>Likewise, in "Tedium," Kouzma Kossiyak
thus clearly expresses himself:</p>

<p>"I would not give up my liberty for any
woman, nor for any fireplace. I was born in a
shed, do you hear, and it is in a shed that I am
going to die; that is my fate. I am going to
wander everywhere until my hair turns grey....
I get bored when I stay in the same place."</p>

<p>In their feeling of hostility to all authority,
and all fixed things, including bourgeois
happiness and economical principles, some of
Gorky's characters resemble some of those superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
heroes of Russian literature, like Pushkin's
Evgeny Onyegin, Lermontov's Pechorine, and,
finally, Turgenev's Rudin, who, in their way,
are vagabonds, filled with the same independent
spirit in their respective social, intellectual, or
political circles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gorky's wandering beggars
are closely related to those "free men" to
whom M.&nbsp;S. Maximov attributes a historic r&ocirc;le
which was favorable to the extension of the
Russian empire. "Russia," he says, in his book,
"Siberia and the Prison," "lived by vagabondage
after she became a State; thanks to the
vagabonds, she has extended her boundaries:
for, it is they who, in order to maintain their
independence, fought against the nomad tribes
who attacked them from the south and the
east...."</p>

<p>There is a marked difference between these
two classes: men of the former look for a place
on this earth where they can establish themselves;
while men of the other class, those who
are out of work, drunkards, and lazy men, have
no taste for a sedentary life.</p>

<p>But if Gorky has not created the type of
vagabond which is so familiar to those who
know Russian literature, on the other hand, he
has remodeled it with his original, energetic, and
vibrantly realistic talent. His nomad "barefoot
brigade," picturesquely encamped, is surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
with a sort of terribly majestic halo in
these vast stretches of country, a background
against which their sombre silhouettes are set
off. From the perfumed steppes to the roaring
sea, they conjure up to the eye of their old
co-mate the enchanting Slavic land of which
they are the audacious offsprings. And Gorky
also lovingly gives them a familiar setting,
painted with bold strokes, of plains and mountains
which border in the distance the glaucous
stretch of the sea. The sea! With what fervor
does Gorky depict the anger and the peace of
the sea. It always inspires, like an adored mistress:</p>

<p>"... The sea sleeps.</p>

<p>"Immense, sighing lazily along the strand,
it has gone to sleep, peaceful in its huge
stretch, bathed in the moonlight. As soft as
velvet, and black, it mingles with the dark
southern sky and sleeps profoundly, while on
its surface is reflected the transparent tissue of
the flaky, immobile clouds, in which is incrusted
the gilded design of the stars."</p>

<p>Thus, like a "leitmotiv," the murmuring of
the water interrupts the course of the story. And
the steppe, this steppe "which has devoured so
much human flesh and has drunk so much blood
that it has become fat and fecund," surrounds
with its immensity these miserable wandering
beings and menaces them with its storm:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suddenly, the entire steppe undulated, enveloped
with a dazzling blue light which seemed
to enlarge the horizon ... the shadows trembled
and disappeared for a moment ... a
crash of thunder burst forth, disturbing the
sky, where many black clouds were flying
past....</p>

<p>"... At times the steppe stretched forth
like an oscillating giant ... the vast stretch
of blue and cloudless sky poured light down
upon us, and seemed like an immense cupola of
sombre color."</p>

<p>The wind passed "in large and regular
waves, or blew with a sharp rattle, the leaves
sighed and whispered among themselves, the
waves of the river washed up on the banks,
monotonous, despairing, as if they were telling
something terribly sad and mournful," the entire
country vibrated with a powerful life
that harmonized with the souls of the people.</p>

<p>In "Old Iserguile," Gorky writes: "I should
have liked to transform myself into dust and
be blown about by the wind; I should have liked
to stretch myself out on the steppe like the
warm waters of the river, or throw myself into
the sea and rise into the sky in an opal mist;
I should have liked to drink in this evening so
wonderful and melancholy.... And, I know
not why, I was suffering...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Gorky's stories, always short enough, have
little or no plot, and the characters are barely
sketched. But, in these simple frames, he has
confined the power of an art which is prolific,
supple and profoundly living. Let us take, for
example, "The Friends." Dancing Foot and
The One Who Hopes are ordinary thieves, the
terror of the villagers whose gardens they rob.
One day, when they are especially desperate,
they steal a thin horse which is browsing at the
edge of the woods. The One Who Hopes gets
an incurable sickness, and it is perhaps on account
of his approaching death that he feels
scruples at this crime. Dancing Foot expresses
the scorn that the weakness of his companion
inspires him with, but he ends by giving in and
returns the animal. One hour later, The One
Who Hopes falls dead in front of Dancing Foot,
who is tremendously upset in spite of his affected
indifference.</p>

<p>A dry outline cannot possibly convey the emotion
contained in this little drama, where the
low mentality of the characters is rendered with
the mastery which Gorky usually shows in creating
his elemental heroes. Among other works
that should be noted are "Cain and Arteme,"
so poignantly ironical in its simplicity, "To
Drive Away Tedium," "The Silver Clasps,"
"The Prisoner," and that little masterpiece,
"Twenty-Six Men and a Girl," in which we see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
twenty-six bakers pouring out an ideal and mystical
love on Tanya, the little embroiderer, who
they believe, is as pure as an angel. One day, a
brutal soldier comes to defy them, and boasts
that he will conquer this young girl. He succeeds.
Then the twenty-six insult their fallen
idol; the tragedy is not so much in the insults
that they hurl at her, as in the suffering they
undergo through having lost the illusion that
was so dear to them.</p>

<p>Let us note, incidentally, the existence of a
sort of comic spirit in these works which relieves
the tragedy of the situations. In spite
of their dark pessimism, the actors in these
little dramas have an appearance of gaiety
which deceives. It is by this popular humor
that Gorky is the continuator of the work of
Gogol; this is especially noticeable in "The
Fair at Goltva."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In studying Gorky, one is often struck by
the homogeneity of the types which he has described.
Open any of his books, and you will
always meet that "restless" type, dissatisfied
with the banality of his existence, trying to get
away from it, and leaning irresistibly towards
absolute liberty, far removed from social and
political obligations.</p>

<p>Who are these "restless" people? Toward
what end are they striving? What do they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
represent? First, they have an immense reserve
force which they do not know what to do with;
they have got out of the rut, the rut which they
despise, but it is hard for them to create another
sort of existence for themselves. Bourgeois
happiness repulses them, while all sorts
of duties are hateful to them. They consider
the people who are contented with this sort of
a life as slaves, unworthy of the name of man,
and they show the same disdain for the peasants,
for the leading classes, and for the workingmen.
The simple farmer excites the scorn of the
"barefoot brigade:"</p>

<p>"As for me," says one of them, "I don't like
any peasants.... They are all dogs! They
have provincial States, and they do for them....
They tremble, they are hypocrites, but
they want to live; they have one protection:
the soil.... However, we must tolerate the
peasant, for he has a certain usefulness."</p>

<p>"What is a peasant?" asks another. And
he answers the question himself: "The peasant
is for all men a matter of food, that is to say,
an animal that can be eaten. The sun, the
water, the air, and the peasant are indispensable
to man's existence...."</p>

<p>One might think that this hostility was the
fruit of a feeling of envy provoked by the fact
that the peasant seems to enjoy so many advantages.
But, on the contrary, the "barefoot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
brigade" admits that the peasant subjugates
his individuality for any sort of profit, and that
he cannot feel the yoke which he has voluntarily
taken in the hope of getting his daily
bread.</p>

<p>These workingmen "who pitifully dig in the
soil" are unfortunate slaves. "They do nothing
but construct, they work perpetually, their
blood and sweat are the cement of all the edifices
of the earth. And yet the remuneration which
they receive, although they are crushed by their
work, does not give them shelter or enough food
really to live on."</p>

<p>The enlightened classes are always characterized
in Gorky's works by violent traits. The
architect Shebouyev accords a sufficiently great,
but scarcely honorable, place to the category of
intelligent men to whom he belongs.</p>

<p>"All of us," he says, "are nonentities, deprived
of happiness. We are in such great numbers!
And our numbers have been a power for
so long a time! We are animated by so many
desires, pure and honest.... Why is there so
much talk among us and so little action? And,
all the while, the germs are there!... All
these papers, novels, articles are germs ...
just germs, and nothing else.... Some of
us write, others read; after reading, we discuss;
after discussing, we forget what we have read.
For us, life is tedious, heavy, grey, and burdensome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
We live our lives, but sigh from fatigue
and complain of the heavy burdens we are carrying."</p>

<p>The journalist Yezhov, in "Thomas Gordeyev,"
expresses himself in the same manner, but
even more decisively:</p>

<p>"I should like to say to the intelligent classes:
'You people are the best in my country! Your
life is paid for by the blood and tears of ten
Russian generations! How much you have cost
your country! And what do you for her?
What have you given to life? What have you
done?...'"</p>

<p>The absence of all independence, of any passion
even a little sincere, the complete submission
of heart and mind to the old prescribed
morality, the constant effort to realize mere
personal ambitions&mdash;all of these are the reproaches
that Gorky addresses to cultivated
man, whose moral disintegration he proves has
been produced by routine and prejudice.</p>

<p>In contrast to them, the vagabonds are the instinctive
enemies of all slavery, in any form
whatsoever. The complete independence of
their personality means everything to them.
And no material conditions, no matter how prosperous,
will induce them to make the least compromise
on this point. One of these "restless"
types, Konovalov, tells how, after he had bound
himself to the wife of a rich merchant, he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
have lived in the greatest comfort, but he abandoned
everything, the easy life, and even the
woman, whom he loved well enough, in order to
go out and look for the unknown. This is a
common adventure on the part of Gorky's
heroes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is the cause of this restlessness?</p>

<p>"Well, you see," explains Konovalov, "I became
weary. It was such weariness, I must tell
you, little brother, that at moments I simply
could not live. It seemed to me as if I were the
only man on the whole earth, and, with the exception
of myself, there was no living thing anywhere.
And in those moments, everything was
repugnant to me, everything in the world; I
became a burden to myself, and if everybody
were dead, I wouldn't even sigh! It must have
been a disease with me, and the reason why I
took to drink, for, before this time, I never
drank."</p>

<p>For the same reasons, in "Anguish," a workingman
leaves his mistress and his employer, the
miller. Where does this anguish come from?
Perhaps it is the simple result of a psychological
process which, Konovalov admits, is nothing
other than a disease. It is very possible that, in
impulsive acts, a psychiatrist would see something
analogous to alcoholism, or the symptoms
of some other anomaly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Turgenev had already analyzed a similar case
in "The Madman." When Michael Poltev is
asked what evil spirit led him to drink and
to risk his life, he always refers to his anguish.</p>

<p>"'Why this anguish?' asks his uncle.</p>

<p>"'Why?... When the brain is free, one
begins to think of poverty, injustice, Russia....
And that's the end! anguish hastens on....
One is ready to send a bullet through one's
head! There's nothing left to do but get
drunk!...'</p>

<p>"'And why do you associate Russia with all
of that? Why, you are nothing but a sluggard!'</p>

<p>"'But I can do nothing, dear uncle!...
Teach me what I ought to do, to what task I
ought to consecrate my life. I will do it
gladly!...'"</p>

<p>Gorky's characters give the same explanation
of their "ennui," and almost in identical terms.
This disgust comes in great part from not
knowing how to adapt oneself to life, nor how
to become a "useful" man.</p>

<p>"Take me, for instance," says Konovalov,
"what am I? A vagabond ... a drunkard,
a crack-brained sort of man. There is no reason
for my life. Why do I live on earth, and to
whom am I useful? I have no home, no wife,
no children, and I don't feel as if I wanted any.
I live and am bored.... What about? No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
one knows. I have no life within myself, do
you understand? How shall I express it?
There's a spark, or force lacking in my
soul...."</p>

<p>Another character, the shoemaker Orlov, in
"Orlov and His Wife," especially reflects this
pessimistic disposition. In the same way as
Konovalov, he is born with "restlessness in his
heart."</p>

<p>He is a shoemaker; and why?</p>

<p>"As if there weren't enough of them already!
What pleasure is there in this trade for me? I
sit in a cellar and sew. Then I shall die. They
say that the cholera is coming.... And after
that? Gregory Orlov lived, made shoes&mdash;and
died of the cholera. What does that signify?
And why was it necessary that I should live,
make shoes and die, tell me?"</p>

<p>These creatures are under the impression that
they are superfluous; therefore their pessimistic
conclusions. All of them <a class="corr" name="TC_3" id="TC_3" title="pasionately">passionately</a> want to be
able to express the meaning of life in general,
their life in particular, but the task is too much
for them.</p>

<p>Gorky's heroes consider themselves "useless
beings," but they never humiliate themselves.
Their restlessness of spirit does not permit them
to resign themselves to the reigning banality or
to take part in it without protesting. At the
same time, some of them are gifted with sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
personality to possess an unshaken faith
in themselves, in their strength, which keeps
them from letting the responsibility of their torments
fall back upon society.</p>

<p>Promtov, the hero of "The Strange Companion,"
makes these restless seekers the descendants
of the Wandering Jew: "Their
peculiarity," he ironically says, "is, that
whether rich or poor, they cannot find a suitable
place for themselves on earth, and establish
themselves in it. The greatest of them are
satisfied with nothing: money, women, nor
men."</p>

<p>What, then, do these "greatest" want?</p>

<p>Their desires evidently take a multitude of
forms, and have the most diverse shades; but
the greatest number of them are impatient for
extraordinary happenings, eager for exploits.
Some of them declare that they would be willing
to throw themselves on a hundred knives if
humanity could be relieved by their doing so.
But simple daily activity, even if it is useful,
does not satisfy them.</p>

<p>The shoemaker Orlov leaves his cellar, as he
calls it, and accepts a position in the hospital
where they are taking care of cholera patients.
His devotion makes him an "indispensable
man;" he is reborn, and, according to his own
words, he is "ripe for life." It seems as if his
end were going to be attained. But not so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Restlessness seizes him again. Orlov questions
the value of his work. He saves sick people
from the cholera. Is he doing good? The
greatest care is taken of these people, but how
many people are there outside of the hospitals,
one hundred times as many as there are inside,
who are just as unfortunate, but, in spite of
that fact, are not helped by any one?</p>

<p>"While you live," he declares, "no one will
refuse to give you a drink of water. And if
you are near death, not only will they not allow
you to die, but they will go to some expense to
stop you. They organize hospitals.... They
give you wine at 'six and a half rubles a bottle.'
The sick man gets well, the doctors are
happy, and Orlov would like to share their joy;
but he cannot, for he knows that, on leaving the
threshold of the hospital, a life 'worse than the
convulsions of the cholera' awaits the convalescent...."
And again he is seized by the desire
to drink, and to be a vagabond, and by a
wish to experience new sensations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These, then, are the vagabonds whom we can
class in the category of the "restless." After
these, come those whom the author terms the
"ex-men," and whom he studies, under this title,
in one of his longest stories. The ex-men are
closely related to the "restless;" however, they
differ from them in that they push their opinions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to an extreme, for they are, more than the others,
miserable and at bay against society.</p>

<p>"What difference would it make if it all
went to the devil," one of them philosophizes&mdash;"I
should like to see the earth go to pieces suddenly,
provided that I should perish the last,
after having seen the others die.... I'm an
ex-man, am I not? I am a pariah, then, estranged
from all bonds and duties.... I can
spit on everything!"</p>

<p>Thomas Gordeyev's father develops another
thesis; a rich and rational bourgeois, he tries
to inculcate in his son from his infancy&mdash;a
son who later augments the ranks of the
"restless"&mdash;the most perfect spirit of egotism.</p>

<p>"You must pity people," he says, "but do
it with discernment. First, look at a man, see
what good you can get out of him, and see
what he is good for. If you think he is a
strong man, capable of work, help him. But
if you think him weak and little suited for
work, abandon him without pity. Remember
this: two boards have fallen into the mud, one
of them is worm-eaten, the other is sound.
What are you going to do? Pay no attention
to the worm-eaten plank, but take out the sound
one and dry it in the sun. It may be of service
to you or to some one else...."</p>

<p>The reader will note the absolute egotism in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
all of Gorky's types. The "restless" are interested
only in their own misery, and they
think that all men are like them; nor do they
try to stop or bridle their passions.</p>

<p>Strong passions are one of the most precious
privileges of mankind. This truth is well shown
in the story: "Once More About the Devil."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Here, the men have become shabby and insignificant
since there has been propagated among
them, with a new strength, the gospel of individual
perfection. The demon stifles, in the
heart of Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, all the passions
that can agitate a human soul,&mdash;ambition,
pity, evil, and anger; this operation makes
Ivan an absolutely perfect being. On his face
there appears that beatitude which words cannot
express. The devil has crushed all "substance"
out of him, and he is completely
"empty."</p>

<p>One understands that Gorky's heroes cannot
find what would be good for them, nor feel the
least satisfaction in doing their fellow men a
good service. They only dream of action;
their sole desire is to affirm their <a class="corr" name="TC_4" id="TC_4" title="individualty">individuality</a>
by "manifesting" themselves, little matter
how. Old Iserguille is persuaded that "in life,
there is room for mighty deeds" and, if a man
likes them, he will find occasion to do them.
Konovalov is most enthusiastic over Zhermak,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
to whom he feels himself akin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to reduce the whole earth to dust,"
dreams Orlov, "or get up a crowd of comrades
and kill off all the Jews ... all, to the very
last one! Or, in general, do something that
would place me high above all men, so that I
could spit on them from up there, and cry to
them: 'Dogs! Why do you live? You're all
hypocritical rascals and nothing more....'"</p>

<p>These people demand a boundless liberty, but
how obtain it? All of them dream of a certain
organization which will let them feel relieved
of all their duties, of all the thousands of petty
things that make life hard, of all the small details,
conventions, and obligations which hold
such an important place in our society. But
the time for heroic deeds has passed away, and
the "restless" fight in vain against the millions
of men who are determined to keep their habits
and advantages.</p>

<p>Thus they are obliged to shake the dust off
their feet and to leave the ranks in which they
are suffocating. No matter what they do or
what they try to do, their motto is, "each one
for himself."</p>

<p>"Come," says a vagabond poetically to
Thomas Gordeyev, "come with me on the open
road, into the fields and steppes, across the
plains, over the mountains, come out and look
at the world in all its freedom. The thick
forests begin to murmur; their sweet voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
praises divine wisdom; God's birds sing its
glory and the grass of the steppe burns with
the incense of the Holy Virgin.</p>

<p>"The soul is filled with an ardent yet calm
joy, you desire nothing, you envy no one....
And it is then that it seems as if on the
whole earth there is no one but God and
you...."</p>

<p>The material inconveniences of such an existence
hardly affect Gorky's characters. Promtov,
one of the prophets of individualism, says,
in speaking of himself:</p>

<p>"I have been 'on the road' for ten years,
and I have not complained of my fate to God.
I don't want to tell you anything of this period,
because it is too tedious.... In general, it is
the joyous life of a bird. Sometimes, grain is
lacking, but one must not be too exacting and
one must remember that kings themselves do not
have pleasures only. In a life like ours, there
are no duties&mdash;that is the first pleasure&mdash;and
there are no laws, except those of nature&mdash;that
is the second. Without a doubt, the gentlemen
of the police force bother one at times ...
but you find fleas even in the best hotels. As
a set-off, one can go to the right, or to the
left, or straight ahead, wherever your heart bids
you go, and if you don't want to go anywhere,
after having provided yourself with bread from
the hut of some peasant, who will never refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
it, you can lie down until you care to resume
your travels...."</p>

<p>This is the final point at which all of the
"restless" arrive, believing that there they will
find what they have always lacked. Even the
author himself shares their views up to a certain
point:</p>

<p>"You have to be born in civilized society,"
he says, speaking of himself, "in order to have
the patience to live there all your life without
having the desire to flee from this circle, where
so many restrictions hinder you, restrictions
sanctioned by the habit of little poisoned lies,
this sickly center of self-love, in one word, all
this vanity of vanities which chills the feelings
and perverts the mind, and which is called in
general, without any good reason and very
falsely, civilization.</p>

<p>"I was born and brought up outside of it,
and I am glad of that fact. Because of it, I
have never been able to absorb culture in large
doses, without feeling, at the end of a certain
time, the terrible need of stepping out of this
frame.... It does one good to go into the
dens of the cities, where everything is dirty,
but simple and sincere; or even to rove in the
fields or on the highroads; one sees curious
things there. It refreshes the mind; and all
you need in order to do it is a pair of sturdy
legs...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>What then is the teaching that we get out of
Gorky's works? For, faithful to Russian tradition,
he does not practise art for art's sake.
His "barefoot brigade" and his "restless"
men are generally considered as representative
of his own ideals. The principle of "Do what
seems to you to be good"&mdash;a principle which
is expressed by a wandering and free life&mdash;ought
to be justified, one thinks. Critics have
risen up against this ideal, trying to prove how
incompatible the kind of existence that he conceives
is with a solid political organization, and
how far from reality the men are whom he represents.</p>

<p>Doubtless, in real life, people are not as
original and not as heroic as Gorky represents
them to be. And he himself agrees that their
inventive faculties are very highly developed.
He shows this in putting the following words
into the mouth of Promtov:</p>

<p>"I have very probably exaggerated, but
that's not of much importance. For, if I have
exaggerated what happened, my method of exposition
has shown the true state of my soul.
Perhaps, I have served you with an imaginary
roast, but the sauce is made of the purest
truth."</p>

<p>The end that he is after, Gorky has shown us
in his story, "The Lecturer," which contains
his theories on literature. In the person of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lecturer, he addresses himself to the men who
represent the majority of the Russian cultivated
classes. He begins by analyzing himself carefully
and discovers in himself many good feelings
and honest desires, but he feels that he
lacks clear and harmonious thought, a thing
which keeps all the manifestations of life in
equilibrium. Numerous doubts torment him,
and his mind has been so moved with them, his
heart so wounded, that, for a long time, he has
lived "empty inside."</p>

<p>"What have I to say to others?" he asks
himself. "That which was told them long ago,
that which has always been told them, none of
which makes any one any better. But have I
the right to teach these ideas and convictions,
if I, who was brought up according to them,
act so often in opposition to them?"</p>

<p>With his usual sincerity, it is not to be wondered
at that he answered this question in the
negative, and, to cite the words of one of his
characters, that he "refused to live in the chains
which had already been forged for free thought,
and to class himself under the label of an
ism."</p>

<p>He has not thought it profitable to hide his
doubts and has not feared to declare openly
that none of the existing philosophies suit him,
and that he is trying to follow his own path.
All of his work is but the absolute image of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
own uncertainties, of his passionate researches,
and of his constant "restlessness."</p>

<p>At times people have believed that he was a
disciple of Nietzsche. And, in truth, he has
come under his influence, like so many other
Russian authors. But he has gone on mostly
by himself, aided by his acute sensibility, which
has not, as yet, allowed him to adopt any one
system to the exclusion of all others, or to
formulate a system for his personal use.</p>

<p>"I know one thing," he says, "it is not happiness
that we should hope for. What should
we do with it? The meaning of life does not lie
in the search for happiness, and the satisfaction
of the material appetites will never suffice to
make a man fully contented with himself. It
is in beauty that we must look for the meaning
of life, and in the energy of the will! Every
moment of our lives ought to be devoted to
some better end...."</p>

<p>However, he has very neatly set forth what
he considers the task of the author. According
to him, the man of to-day has lost courage; he
interests himself too little in life, his desire to
live with dignity has grown weaker, "an odor
of putrefaction surrounds him, cowardice and
slavery corrupt his heart, laziness binds his
hands and his mind." But, at the same time,
life grows in breadth and depth, and, from day
to day, men are learning to question. And it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
is the writer who ought to answer their questions;
but he should not content himself with
straightening out the balance sheet of social
deterioration, and in giving photographs of
daily life. The writer must also awaken in the
hearts of men a desire for liberty, and speak
energetically, in order to infuse in man an ardent
desire to create other forms of life....
"It seems to me," says Gorky, "that we desire
new dreams, gracious inventions, unforeseen
things, because the life which we have created
is poor, dreary, and tedious. The reality which
formerly we wanted so ardently, has frozen us
and broken us down.... What is there to
do? Let us try: perhaps invention and imagination
will aid man in raising himself so that
he may again glance for a moment at the place
which he has lost on earth."</p>

<p>All of Gorky's characters curse life, but
without ceasing to love it, because they "have
the taste for life." Their complaints are only
a means by which the author hopes to raise up
around him "that revengeful shame and the
taste for life" of which he so often speaks.
Here is the artful Mayakine, who, indignant at
the debasement of the younger generation, is
ready to take the most cruel means in order
"to infuse fire into the veins" of his contemporaries.
Varenka Olessova, the heroine of a
story, incessantly repeats that people would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
more interesting if they were more animated,
if they laughed, played, sang more, if they were
more audacious, stronger, and even more coarse
and vulgar. Gorky admires also the beautiful
type, vigorous, with a rudimentary mentality,
which meets with his approval simply because
he sees in it a nature which is complete, untouched,
and filled with a love of life.</p>

<p>Gorky suffers miseries inherent in the mere
fact of existence, but he has found no remedy;
he looks for consolations in the cult of beauty,
in the strength of free individuality, in the flight
towards a superior ideal. But he does not know
where to find this superior ideal, which vivifies
everything. This is perhaps the reason why
people have thought they saw in his work the
Nietzschean influence, which praises an insistence
on individuality in defiance of current conventions,
and gives us just as vague a solution
as Gorky does.</p>

<p>But this enthusiasm for an ideal, vague as
it is, this passionate appeal for energy in the
struggle, has awakened powerful echoes in the
hearts of the Russians, especially the younger
of them. Gorky suddenly became their favorite
author, and it is to this warm reception that he
owes a great part of his renown. He has carried
the young along with him, and they have
put their ideals in the place which he had left
empty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>If we now pass on to the first novels and
dramas of Gorky, we shall be struck by the
fact that, in spite of the talent shown in them,
they are very inferior to his short stories. His
former mastery is not found, except in his later
novels, which we shall take occasion to mention
presently.</p>

<p>"Thomas Gordeyev" contains some very
fine passages, but is not very successful as a
whole. Thomas's father is a merchant on the
banks of the Volga; he is an energetic man who
carries out all his ideas. Whatever he is engaged
on, whether business affairs, or a debauch,
or repentance thereof, he gives himself entirely
to the impression of the moment. Like other
men of his class, moreover, he lives a life which
is a singular mixture of refinement and savagery.
He spends his time in drinking and working, as
much for himself as for his only son, Thomas,
whose mother died in giving birth to him. The
child grows up under the care of his aunt and
shows a serious disposition toward study.
Gradually, he feels the motives that make men
act, and he questions his father about them.</p>

<p>Before dying, the latter says to his son:
"Don't count on men, don't count on great
events." In spite of the wealth which he inherits
Thomas is not happy; he has no friends;
his colleagues, the merchants, and especially his
father's old friend, Mayakine, are repulsive to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
him on account of their cupidity and their unscrupulousness.
Thomas does not love money
and does not understand its power, two things
that people cannot forgive him for. Besides,
he does not know how to make use of the forces
that are burning within him. After having
vainly sought for moral relief in debauchery,
he ends by proposing to strike a bargain with
Mayakine so that he can be freed from responsibility
and go out and look for happiness. He
will give Mayakine his personal fortune if the
latter will look after his business affairs. But
the old rou&eacute;, who hopes to get possession of
the fortune in a surer way, refuses, and their
conversation turns into a quarrel.</p>

<p>As he does not work, Thomas indulges in
many extravagances in company with a journalist
of very advanced ideas. Finally, one day
when he is at a f&ecirc;te at which are present all
the wealthy members of the merchant class, the
young man, disgusted with their vices, rises to
apostrophize them in the most bitter terms.
They throw themselves on him, and he is arrested
as a madman and put into an asylum.
He comes out, only to abandon himself to drink.</p>

<p>In "The Three," Gorky tells us the life
story of Ilya Lounyev, a poor creature, born
in poverty, whose life is full of deceptions, misfortunes,
even crimes. Several times, Ilya has
tried to lead a decent life; but it is his sincerity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
that makes him lose his position with the merchant
for whom he works. He has believed in
beauty and in the purity of love, and he is deceived
by the woman he loves. Gradually all
the baseness of the world becomes clear to him.
In a moment of jealousy he kills his mistress's
lover, an old miser. Several months later he
publicly confesses his crime, and, in order to
escape from human justice, he commits suicide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his first two dramas, "The Smug Citizen,"
and "A Night's Refuge," as in his short
stories, Gorky shows us his usual characters.</p>

<p>The Bessemenovs, comfortable, petty bourgeois,
have given their children an education.
Their daughter, Tatyana, becomes a school-teacher,
but her profession does not please her.
Peter, their son, has been expelled from the
university, in spite of his indifference toward
"new" ideas. The children are continually
harassed by their father, who bemoans the fact
that he has given them an education. Besides,
another sadness troubles him: Nil, his adopted
son, whom he has had taught the trade of a
mechanician,&mdash;an alert and industrious fellow,&mdash;wants
to marry Polya, a girl without a fortune.
The father is beside himself, for, if Nil
marries, he will never be in a condition to pay
back the money that has been spent on him.
But Nil protests: he is young, and, some day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
he will repay his debt. He has not noticed that
Tatyana is in love with him; and the young
girl has not strength enough to live through
the sorrow of seeing herself abandoned forever.
She tries to commit suicide, but does not succeed.
While Tatyana is bemoaning her fate,
Peter has fallen in love with a young woman
quite different from any of the members of his
family. Helen understands how sad Peter's
position is among these ignorant people, and
she decides to marry him, for pity as much as
for love. The father is no more satisfied with
this match than he was with Nil's, and with
death in his soul he is present at the dismemberment
of his family. While Helen takes Peter,
Nil goes off with Polya. The mother, a humble
and kind woman, does not understand the cause
of all this dissension and, while consoling the
weeping Tatyana, she asks her husband: "Why
are our children punishing us so? Why do
they make us suffer?" This play is not dramatically
effective and has never had a great
success on the stage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gorky's second attempt,
"A Night's Refuge," has been enormously successful.
Here, the author takes us into the
world of the barefoot brigade. Vasska Pepel,
Vassilissa's lover, the proprietor of the night
refuge in which he sleeps, loves the sister
of his mistress, Natasha by name, a timid and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
dreamy young girl, who blooms like a lily in
this mire. The old vagabond, Luke, advises the
young girl to run off with Vasska, who wants to
begin a new life. But Vassilissa, jealous and
evil as she is, has noticed the coldness which her
lover shows towards her. She avenges herself
by striking her younger sister whenever she can.
Her plan was, with the aid of Vasska, to kill
her husband, Kostylev, and then to live openly
with her lover. But when she sees Vasska ready
to leave with Natasha, she starts a terrible scene,
which ends in Vasska's killing Kostylev without
meaning to. Vassilissa and her lover are arrested
and Natasha disappears.</p>

<p>Although the characters of this play are vagabonds,
they differ from most of Gorky's creations,
whose fiery and enthusiastic souls usually
discover a real beauty in the life they have
chosen. Alcoholism, prostitution, and misery
have shut off these people who live in the cellar.
They have fallen so low, that conscience is a
useless luxury for them. It belongs to the rich
only. One of them, who is asked if he has a
conscience, replies with sincere astonishment:
"What? Conscience?" And when the question
is asked again, he answers, "What good
is conscience? I'm not a rich man." The
life of these people is worse than a nightmare:
to-morrow they will be cold, hungry, and drunk,
just as they were yesterday. Sometimes, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
they feel like struggling against their evil
lot, but no one stretches forth a helping hand to
them. They do not dare think of the future,
and they would like to forget the past. One of
them expresses his fear of life thus:</p>

<p>"At times, I'm afraid, brother; can you
understand that?... I tremble.... For, what
is there after this?" And this fear smothers all
the energy in them. They are poor and scantily
clothed, not only in the material sense of the
word, but also in the moral sense. Money would
not be necessary to save them, but a word of
sympathy, of love, a word that would give them
the courage really to live.</p>

<p>And it is here that old Luke appears. He
treats the men as if they were children, and
gains their confidence. In his words there is
manifested a real experience of things and
people. As he says, "They moulded me a lot,"
and that is why he became "tender." He knows
just the right word for every one. He assures
the dying woman that: "Eternal rest means
happiness. Die, and you will have rest, you
will have no cares, and no one to fear. Silence
will calm you! All you have to do is remain
lying down! Death pacifies and is tender. You
will appear before God, and He will say to you:
'Take her to Paradise so that she may rest.
I know that her life has been hard; she is tired,
give her peace.'" And the sick woman, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
has dragged out her existence so long, is consoled.</p>

<p>To the drunkard, a former actor who has
fallen, Luke says: "Stop drinking, pull yourself
together and be patient. You will be cured,
and you will begin a new existence...." And
he succeeds in awakening a hope of a better life
in the soul of the poor comedian, while he himself,
perhaps, hardly believes in the possible regeneration
of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>

<p>After Luke's departure, the temporary
dreams of these miserable people vanish. One
evening, when they are all gathered around a
bottle of brandy, they strike up a song. A
friend, a baron by birth, rushes into the cellar
and announces that the actor has hung himself,
and that his corpse is hanging in the court. A
deathlike silence follows these words. All look
at each other in fright. "Ah, the fool!"
finally murmurs a vagabond, "he spoiled our
song...." The hope in a better life that
Luke had awakened in the actor made him kill
himself, when he saw that he had not enough
strength to realize this hope.</p>

<p>This drama is the quintessence of all that
Gorky has, up to this time, written on the
"ex-man," whom he has thoroughly "explored."
And the figure of old Luke is one of
his most original and lifelike creations.</p>

<p>His third important play, which, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
has never enjoyed the popularity of "A Night's
Refuge," is called: "The Children of the Sun."
The "children of the sun" are the elect of
heaven, richly endowed with talent and knowledge.
They live in a world of noble dreams, of
elevated thoughts, enveloped though they are in
the greyness of life. There pass before them
long processions of tired and oppressed people.
The latter, also, have been generated by the
strong sun; but the light has gone out for
them, and they travel on life's highway without
joy or faith, among those who are proud of
their beauty or learning. The "children of the
sun" are the aristocrats of the soul. They
have but one end: to make life beautiful, good,
and agreeable for all. They continually think
of making it easier, of soothing suffering, and
of preparing a better future. Their mission is
a large one. They are not idle, but are men who
have the most elevated ends in view.</p>

<p>Between "the children of the sun" and "the
children of the earth" there is a deep abyss.
They do not understand each other. The "children
of the sun" cannot admit the miseries and
ugliness of daily life. They have compassion
for the people who work below them. The
"children of the earth" feel the superiority of
the "children of the sun," but their narrow-mindedness,
continually absorbed by the necessity
of finding shelter and food, cannot rise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the preoccupations of so elevated an order.
However, life brings these two worlds together
in a common work; but their mere meeting on
the ground of practical interests produces a
collision.</p>

<p>A third category constitutes the intermediary
link. This is made up of the university people,
the representatives of the liberal professions.
As "intellectuals," they cannot equal the "children
of the sun," but they can understand them.
They conceive the grandeur of their moral activity.
At the same time, these men are close to
the people. They are often obliged to mingle
in the life of the people, and more than the
"children of the sun," they are capable of enlarging
their minds and ennobling their duties.
But, while they know and understand the duties
of the people completely, they are not yet strong
enough to help them. This, then, is the general
meaning of the play.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although this play is cleverly constructed,
with a last act which is pathetic and moving in
its intensity, and produces a profound impression,
on the whole, unfortunately, it has the
general harshness of problem plays. Under its
lyric vestments, its solid and massive character
appears too often. Gorky, a born observer,
inheritor of the realistic traditions of his country,
could not help turning aside, one day, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
this ideological art, visibly influenced by Tolstoy's
dramas. The direct part that the romanticist
has played in the political events of his
country sufficiently proves that he has taken a
different road from that taken by the apostle
of Yasnaya Polyana. With maturity, he felt
the need of hastening the d&eacute;nouement of the
crisis in Russia, in actively participating in its
emancipation. From that time on, he chose his
heroes from a less singular environment. Instead
of the philosophic vagabonds, the neurasthenic
"restless" ones, and the ex-men, he chose
the plebeian of the city and country, who is
gradually awakening from a sleep of ignorance
and slavery. A remarkable story, called "In
Prison," all atremble with new sensations, inaugurates
this new style. A victim himself of
the intolerance of "over-men," Gorky has incarnated
his own revolts and hopes in the soul of
his hero, Misha, a brother of the revolutionary
students who do not hesitate to sacrifice their
life or liberty for a principle or ideal.</p>

<p>Written at the same time, the story called
"The Soldiers" gives proof of an equally careful
incorporation of the claims of the oppressed
in a literary work.</p>

<p>The school-mistress, Vera, has conceived the
daring project of teaching the soldiers who are
quartered in the village. She gets some of them
together at the edge of the neighboring woods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and there she tries to show them the ignominy
of the r&ocirc;les they play in times of uprisings.
Angered by this unexpected talk, the soldiers
threaten the young girl. But her coolness and
sincerity finally make them listen to her with a
respect mingled with admiration.</p>

<p>A third story, called "Slaves," in a masterful
way retraces the catastrophes of the now historical
journey of January 9, 1905, at the end
of which, a crowd of 200,000 men, led by the
famous pope Gapon, went to the Tsar's palace
to present their demands to him, and were received
with cannon shots.</p>

<p>These stories were followed by three works
of great merit: "Mother," "A Confession,"
and "The Spy."</p>

<p>The novel "Mother" takes us into the midst
of revolutionary life. The heroes of this book
belong, for the most part, to that workingman
and agricultural proletariat whose r&ocirc;le has
lately been of such great importance in the Russian
political tempests. With marvelous psychological
analysis, Gorky shows how some of these
simple creatures understand the new truth, and
how it gradually penetrates their ardent souls.</p>

<p>Pavel Vlassov, a young, intelligent workingman,
is thirsty for knowledge, and is the
apostle of the new ideal. He throws himself
heart and soul into the dangerous struggle he
has undertaken against ignorance and oppression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
The Little Russian, Andrey, is all feeling
and thought, and the peasant Rybine is inflamed
by action. Sashenka is a young girl
who sacrifices herself entirely to the Idea, and
the coal-man Ignatius is driven by an obscure
force to help in a cause which he does not understand.
Finest of them all is Pelaguaya
Vlassov, the principal character of the book,
and Pavel's mother.</p>

<p>Old and grey, Pelaguaya has passed her
whole life in misery. She has never known anything
but how to suffer in silence and endure
without complaint; she has never dreamed that
life could be different. One day her father had
said to her:</p>

<p>"It's useless to make faces! There is a fool
who wants to marry you,&mdash;take him. All girls
marry, all women have children; children are,
for all parents, a sorrow. And are you, yes or
no, a human being?"</p>

<p>She then marries the workingman Michael
Vlassov, who gets drunk every day, beats her
cruelly and kicks her, and even on his death-bed,
says: "Go to the devil.... Bitch! I'll die
better alone."</p>

<p>He dies, and his son Pavel begins to bring forbidden
books into the house. Friends come and
talk; a small group is formed. Pelaguaya
listens to what is said, but understands nothing.
Gradually, however, there begins to filter into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
her old breast, like a stream of joy, an understanding
of something big, of something in
which she can take part. She discovers that
she too is a free creature, and, obscurely, there
is formed in her mind the notion that every
human being has a right to live. Then she
speaks: "The earth is tired of carrying so
much injustice and sadness, it trembles softly
at the hope of seeing the new sun which is
rising in the bosom of mankind." So the obscure
and miserable woman gradually rises to
the dignity of "The Mother of the Prophet."
And when Pavel accepts, like the martyrdom
of the cross, his banishment to Siberia, with
a joyous heart she sacrifices her son to the
Idea.</p>

<p>Her soul opens wide to the new truth that is
lighting it. With the most touching abnegation,
she tries to carry on the work of the absent
one. But the police are watching. One
day, when she is about to take the train to a
neighboring town to spread the "good word"
there, she is recognized and apprehended. Seeing
that she is lost, the Mother, whose personality
at this moment grows absolutely symbolic,
cries out to the crowd:</p>

<p>"'Listen to me! They condemned my son
and his friends because they were bringing the
truth to everybody! We are dying from work,
we are tormented by hunger and by cold, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
are always in the mire, always in the wrong!
Our life is a night, a black night!'</p>

<p>"'Hurrah for the old woman!' cries some
one in the crowd.</p>

<p>"A policeman struck her in the chest; she
tottered, and fell on the bench. But she still
cried:</p>

<p>"'All of you! get all your forces together
under a single leader.'</p>

<p>"The big red hand of the policeman struck
her in the throat, and the nape of her neck hit
against the wall.</p>

<p>"'Shut up, you hag!' cried the officer in a
sharp voice.</p>

<p>"The Mother's eyes grew larger and shone
brightly. Her jaw trembled.</p>

<p>"'They won't kill a resurrected soul!'</p>

<p>"'Bitch!'</p>

<p>"With a short swing the policeman struck
her full in the face.</p>

<p>"Something red and black momentarily
blinded the Mother; blood filled her mouth.</p>

<p>"A voice from the crowd brought her to
herself:</p>

<p>"'You haven't the right to strike her!'</p>

<p>"But the officers pushed her, and hit her on
the head.</p>

<p>"'... It's not blood that will drown what's
right.'...</p>

<p>"Dulled and weakened, the Mother tottered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
But she saw many eyes about her, glowing with
a bold fire, eyes that she knew well and that
were dear to her.</p>

<p>"'... They will never get at the truth,
even under oceans of blood!'</p>

<p>"The policeman seized her heavily by the
throat.</p>

<p>"There was a rattling in her throat:</p>

<p>"... 'The unfortunates!'</p>

<p>"Some one in the crowd answered her, with
a deep sigh."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A Confession" is the story of a restless
soul who untiringly searches for the God of
truth and goodness. Found as a child in a
village of central Russia, Matvey was first
taken by a sacristan, and, after his death, by
Titov, the inspector of the domain. In order
to debase Matvey, whose superiority irritates
him, Titov asks him to participate in his extortions.
Having become the son-in-law of his
adopted father, Matvey, on account of his love
for his wife, accepts the shameful life. But the
God in whom Matvey has placed his distracted
confidence, seems to want to chastise him cruelly.
After having lost, one after the other, his wife
and child, he goes away at a venture. He
enters a monastery where, among the dissolute
monks, whose vices are most repugnant, his
soul gradually shakes off the Christian dogma.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
On one of his pilgrimages, he gets to Damascus.
Among the workingmen, where chance has taken
him, he feels his heart opening to the truth,
which he follows up with the determination of
a real Gorkyan hero. The life of the people
appears to him in its sublime simplicity. And
it is in the midst of a dazzling apotheosis&mdash;which
reminds one of the most grandiose pages
of Zola's "Lourdes"&mdash;that he finally confesses
the God of his ideal: it is the people.</p>

<p>"People! you are my God, creator of all
the gods that you have formed from the beauty
of your soul, in your troubled and laborious
search!</p>

<p>"Let there be no other gods on the earth but
yourself, for you are the only God, the creator
of miracles!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The Spy" is a study of the Russian police.
The novel treats of the terrible Okhrana, whose
mysterious affairs have become the laughing-stock
of all the foreign papers.</p>

<p>The principal character, about whom circle
the police spies and secret agents, is a poor
orphan, weak and timid, called Evsey Klimkov,
whom his uncle, the forger Piotr, has taken into
his house and brought up with his son, the
strong and brutal James. Beaten by his
schoolmates and by his cousin, the child lives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
in a perpetual trance. Life seems formidable
to him, like a jungle in which men are the pitiless
beasts. Everywhere, brute force or hypocrisy
triumph; everywhere, the weak are oppressed,
downtrodden, conquered. And in his
feverish imagination, daily excited by facts
which his terror distorts, Evsey delights in conceiving
another existence, all made of love and
goodness, an existence that he unceasingly opposes
against the hard realities of daily life,
with the stubborn fervor of a mystic.</p>

<p>Having entered the service of the old bookseller
Raspopov, the young man does his duty
with the faithfulness of a beast of burden. His
home no longer pleases him at all; there, things
and people are still hostile to him; but his uncle
Piotr seems enchanted with his new position.
Evsey spends his days in arranging and classifying
the books which his master has bought.
A young woman, Ra&iuml;ssa Petrovna, keeps house
for the book-dealer, and as every one knows,
they live like man and wife. In this queer environment,
the faculties of the young man become
sharpened, and serve him well. It does
not take long for him to find out what they are
hiding from him. A few words addressed by
Raspopov to a certain Dorimedonte Loukhine
reveal to Evsey the part that is being played
by his patron. Raspopov, who is an agent of
the secret police, gives Dorimedonte&mdash;who, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the way, is deceiving him with Ra&iuml;ssa&mdash;the
names of the buyers of the forbidden books in
which he trades. And here it is that the tragedy
suddenly breaks forth.</p>

<p>Ra&iuml;ssa, tired of being tormented by Raspopov,
who accuses her of poisoning him,
strangles the old man in a moment of cold anger,
under the very eyes of Evsey. Thanks
to Dorimedonte, this crime goes unpunished.
Evsey, having become the lodger of the two
lovers, now enters the Okhrana, at the advice
of his new master. After a while, Ra&iuml;ssa,
haunted by remorse, commits suicide, and Dorimedonte
is killed by some revolutionists.</p>

<p>All the interest of the book, however, is centered
in the picture of the police institutions.
From the chief Philip Philipovich to the agent
Solovyev, Gorky presents, with consummate art,
the mass of corrupt and greedy agents who
wearily accomplish their tasks.</p>

<p>Among them, young Evsey leads a miserable
and ridiculous existence. Bruised by an invincible
power, he sees himself compelled to arrest
an old man who has confided his revolutionary
ideas to him; then a young girl with
whom he is in love; finally, his own cousin, a
revolutionary suspect.</p>

<p>Gradually his eyes are opened. He realizes
that he cannot extricate himself from the position
in which he has placed himself. Tired of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
leading a life which his conscience disapproves
of, he thinks of killing his superior, who has
driven him to do so many infamous deeds. He
will thus get justice. His project miscarries;
maddened, he throws himself under a passing
train.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These three remarkable works, riddled by the
Russian censor, so that the complete version
has appeared only abroad, have recently been
followed by two important stories: "Among
the People" and "Matvey Kozhemyakine."</p>

<p>With his accustomed power, Gorky shows us,
in the first of these stories, the spread of socialism
among the agricultural proletariat. He
depicts village life with its pettiness and ignominy.
The village is for the most part a backward
place, hostile to everything that makes a
breach in tradition. The hatching of socialism
goes on slowly. From day to day, new obstacles,
helped on by the ignorance of the
peasants, hinder those who are trying to carry
out their belief. Even the village guard,
Semyon, pursues them with his hatred.</p>

<p>But Igor Petrovich, the propagator of these
new ideas, finds, in a few old friends and in a
village woman who becomes his mistress, some
precious helpers. Thanks to them, he gradually
gets up a little circle of firm believers who
gather in a cave in the woods. Every evening,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
they read, discuss, and dream of a better organization,
out there in the cave. All would
have gone well, if some of them had not betrayed
the leader to the police. While being
led to the city prison, the leader spoke to the
soldiers who were escorting him:</p>

<p>"The soldiers trembled as they clicked their
bayonets; they silently listened to the legend
of the generous earth which loves those who
work it. Again, their red faces were covered
with drops of melted snow; the drops ran down
their cheeks like bitter tears of humiliation;
they breathed heavily, they snuffled, and I felt
that they kept walking a little faster, as if
they wanted this very day to arrive in that
fairy land.</p>

<p>"We are no longer prisoners and soldiers;
we are simply seven Russians. I do not forget
the prison, but when I remember all that I
lived through that summer and before that,
my heart fills with joy, and I feel like crying
out:</p>

<p>"Rejoice, beloved Russian people! Your
resurrection is close at hand!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Matvey Kozhemyakine" very brilliantly
returns to Gorky's early manner. In this book
no symbolic character interprets the bold
thoughts of the author. It is simply a novel
of Russian provincial life. Its simplicity does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
not exclude vigor, and it reminds us at times
of Balzac.</p>

<p>Young Matvey is the son of an old workingman
who has become rich, thanks to his energy
and dishonesty. He has grown up in a large
house, adjoining a rope-yard, with his father
and several servants. His mother, whom he
never knew, left home shortly after his birth,
and entered a convent in order to escape the
torments of life. Later, Matvey's father marries
a young girl, in order to provide a mother
for his son, whom he loves dearly. But his new
mother is not long in finding out the dreary
life which she has to lead with the old man.
In order to escape from the tedium of it, she
listens to the interesting experiences of the wandering
life of the porter Sazanov, and gives her
unfaithful love in exchange.</p>

<p>Unexpected circumstances disclose this shameful
adultery to Matvey. Instead of revealing
it to his father, he generously guards the secret.
He even goes so far as to protect her from the
fury of a workingman, named Savka, whom
Sazanov's success has rendered bold. Through
gratitude, and later through love, in the absence
of Kozhemyakine, she becomes the mistress
of her step-son. On his return, the father,
finding out about this "liaison," spares his son,
but beats his wife to death, and himself, mad
with fury, falls, struck with apoplexy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>All the newspapers in the world have attacked
Gorky's way of living. As he is forced to
remain away from his beloved country, the great
writer has made his home in the little island of
Capri, the air of which is propitious to his failing
health. Moreover, its impressive scenery
inspires his restless genius.</p>

<p>Drunk with liberty, taken up with beauty,
always ready to help a man who is in political
and social difficulties, Gorky, from the depths
of his peaceful retreat, wanders out over the
world of ideas in search of truth, as formerly
he used to wander over the earth in search of
bread.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br />
LEONID ANDREYEV</h2>


<p>Leonid Andreyev was born of a humble
bourgeoise family in Orel, in 1871. "It
was there that I began my studies," he says.
"I was not a good pupil; in the seventh form
I was last in my class for a whole year, and I
had especially poor reports as to my deportment.
The most agreeable part of my schooling,
which I still remember with pleasure, was
the intervals between the lessons, the 'recesses,'
and the times, rare as they were, when the instructor
sent me from the class-room for inattention
or lack of respect. In the long deserted
halls a sonorous silence reigned which vibrated
at the solitary noise of my steps; on all sides
the closed doors, shutting in rooms full of
pupils; a sunbeam&mdash;a free beam&mdash;played
with the dust which had been raised during
recess and which had not yet had time to settle;
all of it was mysterious, interesting, full of a
particular and secret meaning."</p>

<p>Andreyev's father, who was a geometrician,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
died while he was still at school, and the family
was without resources. The young man did
not hesitate, however, in setting out for St.&nbsp;Petersburg,
where he entered the university,
hoping to gain a livelihood by giving lessons.
But it was hard to secure what he wanted. "I
knew what terrible misery was," Andreyev tells
us; "during my first years in St.&nbsp;Petersburg
I was hungry more than once, and sometimes
I did not eat for two days."</p>

<p>His first literary productions date from this
sombre epoch. Andreyev gives us remarkably
graphic details of this misery. One day, he
gave a daily paper a story about the tribulations
of an <a class="corr" name="TC_5" id="TC_5" title="every-hungry">ever-hungry</a> student: his own life!</p>

<p>"I wept like a child in writing these pages,"
he confesses. "I had put down all of my sufferings.
I was still affected by my great sadness
when I took the manuscript to the editor.
I was told to come back in a few weeks to find
out whether it had been accepted. I returned
with a light heart, keeping down my anguish
in expectation of the decision. It came to me
in the form of a loud burst of laughter from
the editor, who declared that my work was absolutely
worthless...."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he energetically pursued his
studies, which he completed at the University
of Moscow. "There," he tells us, "life was,
from a material standpoint, less unbearable;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
my friends and the aid society came to my
assistance; but I recall my life at the University
of St.&nbsp;Petersburg with genuine pleasure;
the various classes of students are there more
differentiated and an individual can more easily
find a sympathetic surrounding among such
distinct groups."</p>

<p>Some time after that, Andreyev, disgusted
with life, attempted suicide. "In January,
1894," he writes, "I tried to shoot myself, but
without any appreciable result. I was punished
by religious penance, imposed upon me by authority,
and a sickness of the heart which, although
not dangerous, was persistent. During
this time I made one or two equally unsuccessful
literary attempts, and I gave myself up
with success to painting, which I have loved
since childhood; I then painted portraits to
order for from 5 to 10 rubles....</p>

<p>"In 1897, I received my counsellor's degree
and I took up that profession in Moscow. For
want of time I did not succeed in getting any
sort of a 'clientele'; in all, I pleaded but one
civil case, which, however, I lost completely,
and several gratuitous criminal cases. However,
I was actively working in reporting these
cases for an important paper."</p>

<p>Finally, two strangely impressionistic stories:
"Silence," and "He Was...," published in
an important Petersburg review, brought the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
author into prominence. From that time, he
devoted himself entirely to literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Andreyev is considered, to-day, as one of the
most brilliant representatives of the new constellation
of Russian writers, in which he takes
a place immediately next to Tchekoff, whom he
resembles in the melancholy tone of his work.
In him, as in Tchekoff, the number of people
who suffer from life, either crushed or mutilated
by it, by far exceed the number of happy
ones; moreover, the best of his stories are short
and sketchy like those of Tchekoff. Andreyev
is then, so to speak, his spiritual son. But he
is a sickly son, who carries the melancholy element
to its farthest limit. The grey tones of
Tchekoff have, in Andreyev, become black; his
rather sad humor has been transformed into
tragic irony; his subtle impressionability into
morbid sensibility. The two writers have had
the same visions of the anomalies and the horrors
of existence; but, where Tchekoff has only a
disenchanted smile, Andreyev has stopped, dismayed;
the sensation of horror and suffering
which springs from his stories has become an
obsession with him; it does not penetrate merely
the souls of his heroes, but, as in Poe, it penetrates
even the descriptions of nature.</p>

<p>Thus, the "near and terrible" disk of the
moon hovers over the earth like the "gigantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
menace of an approaching but unknown evil";
the river congeals in "mute terror," and silence
is particularly menacing. Night always comes
"black and bad," and fills human hearts with
shadows. When it falls, the very branches of
the trees "contract, filled with terror." Under
the influence of the disturbing sounds of the
tocsin, the high linden-trees "suddenly begin to
talk, only to become quiet again immediately
and lapse into a sullen silence." The tocsin itself
is animated. "Its distinct tones spread
with rapid intensity. Like a herald of evil who
has not the time to look behind him, and whose
eyes are large with fright, the tocsin desperately
calls men to the fatal mire."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Most of Andreyev's characters, like those of
Dostoyevsky, are abnormal, madmen and neurasthenics
in whom are distinguishable marked
traces of degeneration and psychic perversion.
They are beings who have been fatally wounded
in their life-struggle, whose minds now are completely
or partially powerless. Too weak to
fight against the cruel exigencies of reality,
they turn their thoughts upon themselves and
naturally arrive at the most desolate conclusions,
and commit the most senseless acts.
Some, a prey to the mania of pride, despairing
because of their weakness and their "nothingness,"
look&mdash;as does Serge Petrovich&mdash;for
relief in suicide. Others, who have resigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
themselves to their sad lives, become passive
observers, become transformed into living
corpses whose sole desire is peace; such a one
is the hero of "At the Window." Others still
instinctively choke in themselves the best tendencies
of their characters and are passionately
fond of futile and senseless amusements, by
means of which they enjoy themselves like children,
until a catastrophe makes them "come
back to themselves." This is the idea of the
original story called "The Grand Slam." In
"The Lie" Andreyev depicts the pathological
process in the soul of a man who, crushed by the
falsehood of his own solitary existence, becomes
insane at the idea that truth is inaccessible to
human reason and that the reign of the Lie is
invincible. The hero of "The Thought"<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
reveres but one thing in the world&mdash;his own
thought. Wrapped up in this one idea, he admires
the force and finesse of it, while his reason,
detached from reality and having only
him for an end, begins to weaken, becomes
gradually perverted to the point where this
man, harassed by a terrible doubt, begins to ask
himself whether he is insane. In the long and
pathetic story, "The Life of a Priest," we are
shown the disturbance of the religious feelings
of a country priest who, although he has an
ardent and strong soul, is crushed by his moral
isolation among the ignorant people of a miserable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
village. It is again this moral isolation
that is analyzed in "Silence," in which story
it is the cause of a domestic tragedy. The
same cause provokes a rupture between a father
and a son in "The Obscure Distance," and
brings with it in some way the death of the
neurasthenic student.</p>

<p>In general, the stories of Andreyev, after
passing through various catastrophes, lead the
reader back to this theme,&mdash;the moral isolation
of a human being, who feels that the world
has become deserted, and life a game of
shadows. The abyss which separates Andreyev's
heroes from other men makes them
weak, numb, and miserable. It seems, in fact,
that there is no greater misfortune than for a
man to feel himself alone in the midst of his
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Finally, in "The Gulf," a somewhat imaginary
thesis is developed, based on the terrible
vitality which certain vile instincts keep even
in the purest and most innocent minds, while
the story "He Was ..." shows us the inside
of a clinic, in which there are two dying men
whose illusions of life persist till the supreme
moment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If we carefully study a few of Andreyev's
characters we can more easily understand his
feelings and his style. Here is, for instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Serge Petrovich, a student. Although he is
not very intelligent, he is above the average.
His mind is preoccupied with all sorts of questions;
he reads Nietzsche, he ponders over
many things, but he does not know how to think
for himself. The fact that there are people
who can find a way to express themselves appears
to him as an inaccessible ideal; while
mediocre minds have no attraction for him at
all. It is from this feeling that all his sufferings
come. So "a horse, carrying a heavy
burden, breathes hard, falls to the ground, but
is forced to rise and proceed by stinging lashes
from a whip."</p>

<p>These lashes are the vision of the superman,
of the one who rightfully possesses strength,
happiness, and liberty. At times a thick mist
envelops the thoughts of Serge Petrovich, but
the light of the superman dispels this, and he
sees his road before him as if it had been drawn
or told him by another.</p>

<p>Before his eyes there is a being called Serge
Petrovich for whom all that makes existence
happy or bitter, deep and human, remains a
closed book. Neither religion nor morality,
neither science nor art, exists for him. Instead
of a real and ardent faith, he feels in himself
a motley array of feelings. His habitual
veneration of religious rites mingles with mean
superstitions. He is not courageous enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
deny God, not strong enough to believe in Him.
He does not love his fellow-men, and cannot
feel the intense happiness of devoting himself
to his fellow-creatures and even dying for them.
But neither does he experience that hate for
others which gives a man a terrible joy in his
struggle with his fellow-men. Not being capable
of elevating himself high enough or falling
low enough to reign over the lives of men, he
lives or rather vegetates with a keen feeling of
his mediocrity, which makes him despair. And
the pitiless words of Zarathustra ring in his
ears: "If your life is not successful, if a venomous
worm is gnawing at your heart, know that
death will succeed." And Serge Petrovich,
desperate, commits suicide.</p>

<p>The hero of "At the Window" is quite different.
This man has succeeded in building
for himself a sort of fortress, "in which he retires,
sheltered from life." Like Serge Petrovich,
although not as often, he is tormented by
restless thoughts, and, from time to time, he
is obliged to defend his "fortress." But usually
he is contented with watching life, that is
to say, that part which he can see from his window.
Nothing troubles the tranquillity of his
mind, not even the desire to live like other men.
One day, he speaks of his theories to a simple,
uneducated young girl whom he thinks of
marrying. She is astonished and stupefied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
them. She perceives that he leads an insipid
and morose life. Andrey Nikolayevich does not
take into account or understand the stupefaction
of the young girl.</p>

<p>"This then is your life?" she asks, incredulously.</p>

<p>"This is it. What more could you want?"</p>

<p>"But it must be terribly monotonous to live
in that way, apart from the world."</p>

<p>"What good does one find in mankind?
Nothing but tedium. When I am alone, I am
my own master, but among men you never know
what attitude to take to please them. They
drag you into drunkenness, into gambling;
then they denounce you to your superiors. I,
however, love calmness and frankness. Some of
them accept bribes and allow themselves to become
corrupt; I do not like that.... I adore
tranquillity."</p>

<p>Moreover, he does not marry the young girl.
He gives her up because he is afraid of the incumbrances
that housekeeping will bring.</p>

<p>In "The Grand Slam" four provincial "intellectuals"
are locked up in the same fortress,
and, by playing cards, they escape the terrible
problems of a life which is inimical to them.
Their existence has been passed among these
cards, which, by a mysterious phenomenon,
have become real living creatures to them. One
of the players has dreamed all through his life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of getting a grand slam, when, one evening,
he sees he has the necessary cards in his hand.
He has but to take one more card, the ace of
spades, and his dream will be realized. But at
the very moment when he is stretching forth
his hand to take it, he falls down dead. His
partners are terrified. One of them, a timorous
and exact old man, named Jacob Ivanovich, is
particularly struck. A thought comes to him;
he quickly rises, after making sure that it was
the ace of spades that the dead man was going
to take, and cries:</p>

<p>"But he will never know that he was going
to get the ace of spades and a grand slam!
Never.... Never...."</p>

<p>"Then it appeared to Jacob Ivanovich that,
up to this moment, he had never understood
what death was. Now he understood, and what
he saw was senseless, horrible, and irreparable!...
The dead man would never know!"</p>

<p>The poignant irony of this story is not unusual
with Andreyev.</p>

<p>It is again found in the short and symbolic
story "The Laugh." A student, profiting by
the fact that it is carnival time, disguises himself
as a Chinaman and goes to the house of the
girl he loves. The mute, immobile, and stupidly
calm mask, and the whole "get-up" are
so funny, that the unfortunate man rouses irresistible
laughter wherever he goes. The young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
girl cannot help herself, and, while listening
to his very touching and sincere declaration,
which, at any other time, would have brought
tears to her eyes, she bursts out laughing and
cannot again become serious, although she realizes
that a living and unhappy being is hidden
under this impassive and foolish Chinaman's
mask.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In "The Lie" we see a man who, by isolating
himself from life, has lost the feeling of
reality, and all capacity of discerning the true
from the false. He suffers terribly from the
feeling that something unknown is happening
around him. This man, who would be ready to
sacrifice everything, even his life, in order to
know truth, guesses the lie that comes between
him and the person who is dearest to him. He
falls into a despair that soon turns to fury.
In order to recover his calm, he begs the girl
he loves, whom he suspects of having deceived
him, to reveal the whole truth to him. But he
cannot believe her protestations of innocence.
One word bursts from his being, breaks forth
from the depths of his soul: "Lies! Lies! Lies
everywhere!"</p>

<p>"In looking at her beautiful pure forehead,"
he writes, "I dreamed that truth was there, on
the other side of that thin barrier, and I felt
a senseless desire to break that barrier and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
least to see the truth. Lower down, beneath
her white breast, I heard the beating of her
heart, and I had a mad desire to open her
breast so that I could read, at least once, what
there was at the bottom of her heart."</p>

<p>He ends by killing that which he loved, and
thinks that he is satisfied: he believes he has
killed the lie.</p>

<p>In "The Thought" we see the gradual development
of insanity during the period when
it is doubtful, when the will is almost entirely
annihilated and replaced by a fixed idea, and
when conscience is not entirely abolished. Dr.
Kerzhenzev kills his friend, obeying a mental
suggestion, which now forbids him to do it, now
urges him on. Then, like the "half-insane"
or those sick people who feign madness in order
more easily to attain their end, this man suggests
to himself that he is in reality insane.
This idea gets a hold on him after the murder
and fills his soul with mortal terror, the exposure
of which forms the most supremely
pathetic part of the whole story. All this
drama of a foundering intelligence, complicated
by bizarre contradictions, is developed with a
penetrating power of analysis.</p>

<p>Andreyev tells us that on the day of judgment
the alienists are divided as to the insanity
of Kerzhenzev. The story ends at this place.
But the principal interest of the story does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
lie in this or that solution of the problem, which
is not mysterious, for the doctor is doubtlessly
abnormal, and it is only as to the degree of
insanity that there can be any question. The
main interest lies in another direction, in the
subtle analysis of this special mental condition,
which is done with consummate art.</p>

<p>This story had the honor of occupying an
entire meeting of the psychiatrists attached to
the Academy of Medicine of St.&nbsp;Petersburg.
According to the report of Dr.&nbsp;Ivanov, the
assembly was almost unanimous in declaring the
murderer insane. Another psychiatrist, who
thought he saw proofs of an abnormal mentality
in all the stories of Andreyev, pronounced
the same verdict against Dr.&nbsp;Kerzhenzev, in a
meeting of doctors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"All of priest Vassily Fiveyisky's life was
weighed down by a cruel and enigmatic fatality,"&mdash;it
is thus that the story, "The Life of
a Pope," opens. "As if struck by an unknown
malediction, he had from his youth been made
to carry a heavy burden of sorrows, sickness
and misfortunes; he was solitary among men
as a planet is among planets; a peculiar and
malevolent atmosphere surrounded him. Son of
an obscure, patient, and submissive village
priest, he also was patient and submissive, and
he was a long time in recognizing the particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
rancour of destiny. He fell rapidly and arose
slowly. Twig by twig he restored his nest.
Having become a priest, the husband of a good
woman, the father of a son and a daughter, he
thought that all was going well with him, that
all was solidly established, and that he would
remain thus forever. And he blessed God."</p>

<p>But fate was always on the watch for him.
It had showed him happiness only to take it
away again. After seven years of prosperity,
his little son is drowned one summer's day in
the river. Death and nameless misfortunes
again invade the home of Vassily. One does not
live there any more, one prowls around gropingly
in a mournful stupor. From morning
till evening, his wife comes and goes, silent and
indifferent to everything, as if she were looking
for some one or something.</p>

<p>In losing his son, poor Vassily has also lost
his wife, his helpmate and friend, for the unfortunate
woman takes to drink. The faith of
the priest holds in this terrible trial. But
his misery increases immeasurably. The vice
of his wife, his own sick weakness, excite the
meanness of the people. Insults have to be borne
in silence, tears hidden. At home, the priest's
wife has no rest. She has the idea that she can
have another son who will take the place of
the dead one and be a balm to her broken heart.
In her alcoholic desire, a prey to savage fury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
she demands that her husband gratify her desire.</p>

<p>"Give him to me, Vassily! Give him back to
me, I tell you...."</p>

<p>At last her desire is realized: a son is born
to her; but the child, conceived in madness, is
born half-witted. The mother takes to drink
again, and the despair of Vassily increases.
One day the unfortunate woman hangs herself.
The pope comes in, however, in time to save
her; but now another noose has tightened itself
about the priest's heart. One question oppresses
him:</p>

<p>"Why these sufferings? If God exists, and
if God is love, how is such misery possible?"</p>

<p>Vassily's faith trembles. He decides to leave
his cassock, to fly, to put his idiot son out to
board and to start life over again. This resolution
relieves him. His wife breathes easier.
It seems to him that she also can begin a new
life. But fate does not loosen its reins.</p>

<p>One day, on coming back from the harvest, he
finds his house burned. His wife, in a drunken
stupor, had probably set fire to it. She is
dying of her burns. Vassily can only sigh.
This new misfortune does not put an end to the
priest, but rather inspires him. His old faith
comes back, he sees in this supreme test a predestination.
He kneels down and cries:</p>

<p>"I believe! I believe! I believe!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>From that time on he devotes himself entirely
to prayer and macerations. He lives in perpetual
ecstasy. The people around him understand
nothing of this change and are astounded.
Every one of them is waiting for something
unusual. And their waiting is not in vain.
One day, when he is delivering the funeral oration
of a workingman, who has been suddenly
killed, Vassily abruptly interrupts the ceremony,
approaches the corpse, which has begun
to decay, and addresses it thus three times:</p>

<p>"I tell you: arise!"</p>

<p>But the dead man does not move. Then the
priest looks at this inert and deformed corpse.
He notices the fetid odor that arises from it,
the odor of the slow but sure decomposition,
and he has a sort of sudden revelation. The
scepticism which, for a long time, has been
brooding in his heart suddenly is transformed
into absolute negation, and addressing himself
to Him in whom he had believed, Vassily cries
out:</p>

<p>"Thou wishest to deceive me? Then why
did I believe? Why hast Thou kept me in
servitude, in captivity, all of my life? No free
thought! No feeling! No hope! All with
Thee! All for Thee! Thee alone! Well, appear!
I am waiting! I am waiting!... Ah!
Thou dost not want to? Very well...."</p>

<p>He does not finish. In a burst of savage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
madness he rushes forth from the now empty
church. He rushes straight ahead and finally
falls in the middle of the road. Death has put
an end to his miseries.</p>

<p>"Silence" also shows us a priest, stubborn
in his prejudices. This man, Father Ignatius
by name, is a sort of rude and authoritative
Hercules. All tremble before his stern air, except
his daughter, who has decided to continue
her studies in St.&nbsp;Petersburg, against the will
of her father. Coming back to her home after
a long absence, she wanders about, sad and
silent. For days at a time she wanders about,
pale and melancholy, speaking little, seeking
solitude. She hides what oppresses her; she
keeps her secret from all. One night, she
throws herself under a train, taking her secret
with her.</p>

<p>Her grief-stricken mother gets a paralytic
stroke which transforms her into a sort of living
corpse. The father, crushed by these two catastrophes,
which have destroyed all the joy of his
life, becomes the prey of a singular mental
state: his conscience revolts against the severe
maxims and the pitiless prejudices that he has
always defended. Tender love, which he has
hitherto concealed under his pride, now softens
him; he needs affection, and a vague feeling
suggests to him that he himself is to blame for
all of these misfortunes. His past life, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
daughter, and his wife appear to him as so
many enigmas which raise anguishing questions
in his heart. He calls out, but no one answers.
A death-like silence has invaded the presbytery,
and this silence is especially dreadful near the
paralyzed wife, who is dying without speaking.
Even her eyes do not betray a single thought.
Gradually, a terrible desire to know why his
daughter committed suicide seizes him. At twilight,
softly, in his bare feet, he goes up to the
room of his dead daughter and speaks to her.
He entreats her to tell him the truth, to confess
to him why she was always so sad, why she
has killed herself. Only the silence answers
him. Then he rushes to the cemetery, where his
daughter's tomb irresistibly attracts him; again
he implores, begs, threatens. For a moment he
thinks that a vague answer arises from the
earth; he places his ear on the rough turf.</p>

<p>"Vera, tell me!" he repeats in a loud and
steady voice.</p>

<p>"And now Father Ignatius feels with terror
that something sepulchrally cold is penetrating
his ear and congealing his brain; it is Vera,
who is continually answering him with the same
prolonged silence. This silence becomes more
and more sinister and restless, and when Father
Ignatius arises with an effort, his face is as
livid as death."</p>

<p>Crushed by the same blind destiny which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
annihilated the powerful personality of Father
Ignatius, the piteous and tearful hero of "The
Marseillaise" moves us even more than does the
old priest. The poor fellow cannot grasp the
reason for the ferocity of stupid fate, which
unrelentingly preys upon him. Arrested by
mistake as a revolutionist and condemned to
deportation, he becomes an object of derision
to his comrades. However, gradually, he finds
the strength to share the severe privations of
his companions who have sacrificed themselves
to their ideal of justice and liberty. And, on
his death-bed, he is elated by all that he has
endured; he dreams of liberty, which, up to this
time, had been indifferent to him, and asks
them to sing the Marseillaise over his grave.</p>

<p>"He died, and we sang the Marseillaise. Our
young and powerful voices thundered forth this
majestic song of liberty, accompanied by the
noise of the ocean which carried on the crests
of its waves towards 'dear France,' pale terror
and blood-red hope.</p>

<p>"It became our standard forever, the picture
of this nonentity with the hare's body and the
man's heart.</p>

<p>"On your knees to the hero, friends and
comrades!</p>

<p>"We sang. The guns, with their creaking
locks, were pointed menacingly at us; the steel
points of the bayonets were pointed at our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
hearts. The song resounded louder and louder,
with increasing joy. Held in the friendly hands
of the 'strugglers,' the black coffin slowly sank
into the earth.</p>

<p>"We sang the Marseillaise!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two main characters of "The Gulf," a
student and a school-girl, are walking and discussing
rather deep things, such as immortality
and the beauty of pure and noble love. They
feel some sadness in speaking about these things,
but love appears more and more luminous to
them. It rises before their eyes, as large as
the world, bursting forth like the sun and marvelously
beautiful, and they know that there is
nothing so powerful as love.</p>

<p>"You could die for the woman you loved?"
asked Zinochka.</p>

<p>"Of course," replies Nemovetsky unhesitatingly,
in a frank and sincere voice, "and
you?"</p>

<p>"I too!" She remains pensive a moment.
"To die for the one you love, that is a great
happiness! Would that that were to be my
destiny!"</p>

<p>Gradually night falls. Nemovetsky and his
companion lose their way in the woods; they
finally arrive in a clearing, where three filthy-looking
men are seated about an empty bottle.
These intoxicated men, whose wicked eyes light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
up with a brutal envy of enjoyment and love
of destruction, try to quarrel with Nemovetsky,
and one of them ends by striking him full in the
face with his fist. Zinochka runs away. His
heart full of terror, Nemovetsky can hear the
shrieks of his friend, whom the vagabonds have
caught. Then a feeling of emptiness comes
over him, and he loses consciousness. Two of
the men throw him into a ravine.</p>

<p>An hour later, Nemovetsky regains consciousness;
he gets up with great pain, for he is badly
wounded. He remembers what has happened.
Fright and despair seize him. He begins to run
and call for help with all his strength, at the
same time looking among all the bushes, when
at his feet, he sees a dim, white form. It is
his companion, who lies there motionless. He
falls down on his knees and touches her. His
hand encounters a nude body, damp and cold,
but still living. It seems to grow warm at his
touch. He pictures to himself with abominable
clearness what the men have done. A feeling of
strange strength circulates in his members. On
his knees in front of the young girl, in the
obscurity of the forest, he tries to bring her
back to life, calling her sweet names, caressing
her hair, rubbing her cold hands.</p>

<p>"With infinite precautions, but also with
deep tenderness, he tries to cover her with the
shreds of her torn dress, and the double sensation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of the cloth and the nude body are as keen
as a sword and as inconceivable as madness.
And now he cries for help, now he presses the
sweet and supple body to his breast. His unconscious
abandonment unchains the savageness
of his passion. He whispers in a low voice, 'I
love you, I love you.' And throwing himself
violently upon her lips, he feels his teeth entering
her flesh.</p>

<p>"Then, in the sadness and impetuousness of
the kiss, the last bit of his mind gives way. It
seems to him that the lips of the young girl
tremble. For an instant, a terrible terror fills
his soul and he sees a horrible gulf yawning at
his feet.... And he hurls himself into the
mad throes of his insane passion."</p>

<p>The account of the collegian, which forms
the plot of the story "In the Fog," is even
more daring in its realism. It actually oppresses
the reader, not so much by certain details
that provoke disgust, as by the analysis
of the sufferings of an unfortunate young man,
whose mind is pure, but who has let himself be
dragged into excesses which are followed by a
sickness of ill name. Severely reprimanded by
his father, the poor young fellow, overcome
with sorrow, the victim of an instinct which he
could not conquer, ends his days in a most horrible
way: one evening, he leaves home and goes
out into the streets in an adventuresome spirit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
A half-intoxicated prostitute touches him in
passing; he follows her. As they go along, a
conversation starts up, and the young man, although
she is repugnant to him, goes home with
her. Once in her room, a violent quarrel starts
up and he kills her, and then commits suicide.</p>

<p>These two stories, especially "The Gulf,"
caused many lively discussions on the part of
the public, and then in the newspapers. Mr.
Bourenine, the well-known critic of the "Novoye
Vremya," says that he received from several correspondents
a series of letters which blamed
Andreyev vehemently and requested that this
"skunk" of literature be called to order according
to his deserts. These protestations
were re&euml;nforced by an ardent letter from
Countess Tolstoy, the wife of the great author,
who reproached Andreyev for having so complacently
painted such sombre pictures, with
such low and violent scenes, all of which tended
to pervert youth. The writers were not the
only ones to take offence. Two important Russian
newspapers organized a sort of inquiry,
and they published many of the answers received
from the young people of both sexes, but
these were all favorable to Andreyev.</p>

<p>In truth, all these judgments are too passionate.
It is true that "most of the critics
have understood Andreyev only in a superficial
manner," as Tolstoy rightfully asserted. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
double impression, for instance, produced by
"The Gulf," is the result of a simple misunderstanding.
Those who think that the adventure
of young Nemovetsky is a slice of life and
characterizes certain psychological states, have,
without a doubt, the right to judge this story
as an indiscretion, and to reproach the author
with a deviation from morality; but Andreyev
has not taken his hero from reality; he has not
tried to give us a picture of manners, but has
expressed an idea, born in his brain under the
influence of the philosophy of Nietzsche. It illustrates
the terrible power and the brutality of
a dormant instinct lurking in the purest minds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides, "The Gulf" and "In the Fog" are
compositions which are exceptional in the work
of Andreyev. The idea that he mostly presents
is not the power of bestial instincts, but rather
the indestructible vitality of human feelings and
aspirations towards a better existence, which
sometimes comes to light among the most miserable
and depraved people, and even among those
who are in the most abject material condition.</p>

<p>In the destiny of these beings, there are, however,
rays of hope. The slightest incident serves
to transform them; suddenly their hearts begin
to beat happily, tears of tenderness moisten
their eyes, they vaguely feel the existence of
something luminous and good. A profound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
sensibility, an ardent love of life bursts forth
in their souls. This sensibility, this attachment
to existence, form the theme of four touching
stories: "He Was," "Petka in the Country,"
"The Cellar," and "The Angel."</p>

<p>The action of "He Was" takes place in a
hospital, where a deacon, a foolishly debonair
man, who is attached to his stunted existence,
and a pessimistic merchant, thoroughly satiated,
are at the point of death. The deacon has an
incurable sickness, and his days are numbered.
But he does not know it, and speaks with enthusiasm
of the pilgrimage he is going to make
after he is cured, and of the apple-tree in his
garden, which he expects will bear a great deal
of fruit. The fourth Friday of Lent he is taken
into the amphitheatre. He comes back, very
much moved and making the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>"Ah! my brothers," he says, "I am all upset.
The doctor made me sit down in a chair
and said to the students: 'Here you see a sick
man.' Ah! how painful it was to hear him add:
'He was a deacon!'"</p>

<p>"The unfortunate man stopped, and continued
in a choking voice: '"He was a deacon,"
the doctor told them. He told them the story
of my whole life, he even spoke about my wife.
It was terrible! One would have said that I was
dead already, and that he was talking over my
coffin.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"And as the deacon is thus speaking, all
of the others see clearly that he is going to
die. They see it as clearly as if death itself
was standing there, at the foot of the
bed...."</p>

<p>The merchant is a very different sort of man:
he does not believe in God; he has had enough
of life and is not afraid of death. All of his
strength he has spent unnecessarily, without
any appreciable result, without joy. When he
was young he had stolen meat and fruit from
his master. Caught in the act, he had been
beaten, and he detested those who had struck
him. Later on, having become rich, he crushed
the poor with his fortune and scorned those who,
on falling into his hands, answered his hate with
scorn. Finally, old age and sickness had come;
people now began to steal from him, and he, in
turn, beat those whom he caught terribly. And
thus his life had been spent; it had been nothing
but a series of transgressions and hatreds,
where the flames of desire, in dying out, had left
nothing but cold ashes in his soul. He refuses
to believe that any one can love this existence,
and he disdainfully looks at the sallow face of
the deacon, and mutters: "Fool!" Then, he
looks at the third man in the room, a young
student who is asleep. This student never fails
to embrace his fianc&eacute;e, a pretty young girl,
whenever she comes to see him. As he looks the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
merchant, more bitterly than before, repeats:
"Fool!"</p>

<p>But death approaches; and this man who
thinks himself superior and who scorns the deacon
because he dreams of light and the sun, now
feels disturbed in his turn. In making up the
balance-sheet of this existence which, up to this
time, he believed he hated, he remembers a
stream of warm light which, during the day,
used to come in through the window and gild the
ceiling; and he remembers how the sun used to
shine on the banks of the Volga, near his home.
With a terrible sob, beating his hands on his
breast, he falls back on his bed, right against
the deacon, whom he hears silently weeping.</p>

<p>"And thus they wept together. They wept
for the sun which they were never to see again,
for the apple-tree with fruit which they were not
going to eat, for the shadow that was to envelop
them, for dear life and cruel death!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Petka&mdash;the hero of "Petka in the Country"&mdash;is,
at ten years of age, a barber's apprentice.
He does not yet smoke as does his
thirteen year old friend Nicolka, whom he wants
to equal in everything. Petka's principal occupation,
in the rare moments when the shop is
empty, is to look out of the window at the
poorly dressed men and women who are sitting
on the benches of the boulevard. In the meantime,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Nicolka goes through the streets of ill
fame, and comes back and tells Petka all his
experiences. The precocious knowledge of
Nicolka astonishes the child, whose one ambition
is to be like his friend one of these days. While
waiting, he dreams of a vague country, but he
cannot guess its location nor its character. And
no one comes to take him there. From morning
till evening he always hears the same jerky cry:
"Some water, boy!"</p>

<p>But one morning his mother, the cook Nadezhda,
tells the barber that her master and mistress
have told her to take Petka to the country
for a few days. Then begins for him an enchanted
existence. He goes in bathing four
times a day, fishes, goes on long walks, climbs
trees, rolls in the grass. When, at the end of a
week, the barber claims his apprentice, the child
does not understand: he has completely forgotten
the city and the dirty barber-shop; and the
return is very sad. Again is heard the jerky
cry: "Some water, boy!" followed by a menacing
murmur of "Come! Come!" if the child
spills any of the water, or has not understood
the orders.</p>

<p>"And, during the night, in the place where
Petka and Nicolka sleep side by side, a weak
little voice speaks of the country, of things that
do not exist, of things that no one has ever
heard of or seen!..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Cellar" is inhabited by absolutely
fallen people. A baby has just been born
there. With down-bent necks, their faces unconsciously
lighted up by strangely happy
smiles, a prostitute and a miserable drunkard
look at the child. This little life, "weak as a
fire in the steppe," calls to them vaguely, and
it seems to promise them something beautiful,
clear, and immortal. Among the inhabitants of
this cellar, the most unfortunate of all, is a man
named Kizhnakov; he is pale, sickly, worn by
work, almost devoured by suffering and alcohol;
death already lies in wait for him. The most
terrible thing for this man is the necessity of
having to begin to live again each day. He
would like to lie down all day and think of suicide
under the heap of rags that serve him as
a covering. He would like best to have some
one come up back of him, and shoot him. He
fears his own voice and his own thoughts. And
it is on him that the baby produces the deepest
impression. Since the birth of the child Kizhnakov
does not sleep any more; he tries to protect
himself from the cold, and weeps softly,
without sadness and without convulsions, like
those who have pure and innocent hearts, like
children.</p>

<p>"'Why do I weep?' he asks himself.</p>

<p>"Not finding a suitable answer, he replies:
'It is thus....'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the meaning of his words is so deep
that a new flood of tears come to the eyes of the
man whose life is so sad and solitary."</p>

<p>We find the same theme again in "The
Angel." A child who also lives in a cellar comes
back from a Christmas-tree; he brings with him
a toy, and a pretty little wax angel, which he
shows to his father. The latter has seen better
days, but in the last few years he has been sick
with consumption, and now he is awaiting death,
silent and continually exasperated by the sight
of social injustice. However, the delight of
the child infects the father, and both of them
have a feeling "of something that joins all
hearts into one, and does away with the abyss
which separates man from man, and makes him
so solitary, unfortunate, and weak." The poor
dying man seems to hear a voice from this better
world, where he once lived and from which he
had been sent forever.</p>

<p>But these are only the dreams of a dying man,
the last rays of light of the life which is being
extinguished. The ray, penetrating this sick
soul, is like the weak sunlight which passes
through the dirty windows of a dark hovel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his two stories, "The Stranger" and
"The Obscure Future," Andreyev shows us two
men of entirely different character, animated
by generous feelings and a firm will. One of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
them, a young student, being disgusted with the
miseries of Russian life and having decided to
expatriate himself, suddenly changes his mind,
as a result of the patriotism of one of his
friends, a Servian, named Raiko. He makes
it his duty never to leave his country, although
life there is so terrible and hopeless. There is,
in this new feeling, an immense joy and a terrible
sadness. The other, the hero of the second
story, having one day expressed to his father
the hatred he has for the bourgeois life that
he is leading, leaves his family, who love him,
in order to penetrate the "obscure future."</p>

<p>Evidently, these are people who are fitted to
struggle. However, these strugglers, so infrequent
in the work of Andreyev, have, in spite
of all, something sickly and savage in them;
instead of real fighting courage, they possess
only extreme audaciousness, mystical rapture,
or nervous exaltation. The "obscure future"
toward which their eyes are turned is not lighted
up by the rays of faith and hope.</p>

<p>The question is whether Andreyev himself
believes in the triumph of the elements of life
over the elements of death, the horror of which
he excels in portraying for us. It is in the following
manner that he expresses himself in one
of his essays entitled, "Impressions of the
Theatre": "In denying everything, one arrives
immediately at symbols. In refuting life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
one is but an involuntary apologist. I never
believe so much in life as when I am reading the
father of pessimism, Schopenhauer! As a result,
life is powerful and victorious!... It is
truth that always triumphs, and not falsehood;
it is truth which is at the basis of life, and justifies
it. All that persists is useful; the noxious
element must disappear sooner or later, will inevitably
disappear."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What, then, constitutes the essence of Andreyev's
talent is an extreme impressionability,
a daring in descriptions of the negative sides of
reality, melancholy moods and the torments of
existence. As he usually portrays general suffering
and sickness rather than definite types,
his heroes are mostly incarnations and symbols.
The very titles of some of his stories indicate
the abstract character of his work. Such are:
"Silence," "The Thought," and "The Lie."
In this respect he has carried on the work of
Poe, whose influence on him is incontestable.
These two writers have in common a refined and
morbid sensibility, a predilection for the horrible
and a passion for the study of the same kind
of subjects,&mdash;solitude, silence, death. But the
powerful fantasy of the American author,
which does not come in touch with reality, wanders
freely through the whole world and
through all the centuries of history. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
heroes take refuge in half-crumbled castles, they
look at the reader from the top of craggy rocks,
whither their love of solitude has led them; even
death itself is not a repulsive skeleton, but
rather a majestic form, full of grandiose mystery.
Andreyev, on the other hand, but rarely
breaks the bounds which unite him to reality.
His heroes are living people, who act, and whose
banal life ends with a banal death. This realism
and this passionate love of truth make the
strength and the beauty of all his work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A certain harmony between the imaginative
and the real element is characteristic of the best
of Andreyev's productions, especially his last
stories: "The Red Laugh," "The Governor,"
"The Shadows," and "The Seven Who Were
Hanged."</p>

<p>"The Red Laugh" is the symbol, the incarnation,
of the bloody and implacable cynicism
of war. The psychologist of the mysterious
has, in these pages, recorded the terrifying aspects
of the Manchurian campaign, which one
could not have foreseen in all of its horror. He
has shown in a lasting manner the poor human
creature torn from his home, debased to the
r&ocirc;le of a piece of mechanism. Not knowing
where he is being led to, he goes, making murderous
gestures, the meaning of which he does
not know, without even having the illusory consolation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of possible personal bravery, being
killed by the shots of an invisible enemy, or,
what is worse, being killed by the shots of his
own comrades&mdash;and all of this, automatically,
stupidly. The feeling of terror, the somewhat
mystical intuition of events which, at times,
seem to be paradoxes in the other works of
Andreyev, are perfectly adapted to this terribly
real representation of the effects of
war.</p>

<p>The inner drama which Andreyev analyzes in
"The Governor" makes a bold contrast with
the violent pages of "The Red Laugh," the
savage powers of which attain the final limits of
horror.</p>

<p>The governor has during his whole life been
a loyal and strict servant of the Tsar. On the
day of an uprising he mercilessly beat the
enemies of his master; he blindly accomplished
what he thought was his duty. But, since that
bloody day, a new and unceasing voice speaks
in his conscience. The irreparable act has forever
isolated him from his fellow-creatures, and
even from his friends who congratulate him
upon his fine conduct. A stranger to all that is
happening around him, he is left alone to fight
with his conscience, which soon crushes him with
all the weight of remorse. He knows that he
has been condemned by a revolutionary tribunal.
A young girl who is a stranger to him writes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
him a compassionate letter: "You are going
to be killed," she says, "and that will be justice;
but I have great pity for you." This
discerning and youthful sympathy penetrates
his heart, which finally opens&mdash;alas, too late,&mdash;to
justice and pity.</p>

<p>This marks the beginning of a terrible
agony. The governor makes no effort to escape
from the fatal judgment. Always alone, he
contemplates his terrible distress and awaits the
coming of the judiciary. He feels that he has
incurred universal blame, and at times he comes
to wish for death, which surprises him suddenly
as he is turning the corner of a street:</p>

<p>"The whole thing was short and simple, like
a scene from a moving-picture play. At a
cross-ways, close by a muddy spot, a hesitating
voice called to the governor:</p>

<p>"'Your honor!'</p>

<p>"'What?'</p>

<p>"He stopped and turned his head: two men
who had come from behind a wall were crossing
the street, and were shuffling along in the mud
towards him. One of them had in his left hand
a piece of folded paper; his other hand was
in his pocket.</p>

<p>"And immediately, the governor knew that
death had come; and they knew that the governor
knew.</p>

<p>"While keeping the paper in his left hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the unknown man took a revolver out of his
pocket with difficulty.</p>

<p>"The governor glanced about him; he saw
a dirty and deserted square, with bits of grass
growing in the mud, and a wall. But what did
it matter, it was too late! He gave a short but
deep sigh, and stood erect again, fearless, but
without defiance.... He fell, with three shots
in his body."</p>

<p>This drama of conscience is set forth with
admirable sureness of analysis, and the author
has been able to represent with impressive intensity
the mysterious fatality which demands
the death of the guilty one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is this same fatality, under whose hand all
men are equal, which makes the hero of "The
Shadows," a young terrorist who has taken
refuge in a house of ill-fame, obey the strange
desire of his bed-companion.</p>

<p>"Stay with me!" cries the young girl, in
whom is incarnated his destiny, at the moment
that he is going to leave the establishment in
order to escape from the spies who are following
him. "You are an honest man! And I've
been waiting five years to meet an honest man....
Stay with me, because you belong to me."</p>

<p>After a terrible internal combat the man
yields to this unknown will which is oppressing
him. A traitor to his party, he decides to become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the companion of this painted girl, with
whom he then gets drunk.</p>

<p>"As long as I am in the shadows," he murmurs
with the sombre resignation of an Andreyev
hero, "I might as well remain there."</p>

<p>At dawn, the police come to arrest him. And
while his friend tries desperately to resist the
agents of the force, he contemplates the brutal
scene with an ironic smile.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The Seven Who Were Hanged," written in
1908, right after the executions at Kherson
and Warsaw, shows us pictures of terror and
fright aptly described by the genius of Andreyev.
This work has prodigious color and
strength, and one experiences deep emotions on
reading it. Five terrorists, captured at the
very moment when they are going to assassinate
a minister, and two criminals, are condemned
to be hanged on the same day. The
writer shows them to us tortured by the most
horrible anguish, that which immediately precedes
death. The word "madness" appears on
every page: mystical madness of hallucination
that hears music and voices, such is that of the
young revolutionary Moussya; then there is
the brutal madness of her comrades Kashirine
and Golovine, who are ready to scream with
terror; the madness of the victims, the frenzy
of the executioners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The night before the execution the prisoners
are visited by their relatives. The farewell
which Serge Golovine takes of his family is
rightly considered one of the most poignant
and most cleverly constructed scenes that Andreyev
has ever written.</p>

<p>Followed by his mother, who totters along,
Serge's father, a retired colonel, enters the
room where visitors are received. Serge does
not know that the colonel spent the whole night
in preparing for this meeting. He has told
his wife what to do: embrace her son, keep
from crying, and say nothing. But the unhappy
mother in the presence of her son cannot
control her emotions; her eyes are strained
and she breathes faster and faster.</p>

<p>"Don't torture him!" commands the colonel.</p>

<p>Several stupid and insignificant words are
exchanged in order to hide the terrible suffering
that they all are going through. The visit
ends: the parents must bid their son good-bye
forever. The mother gives her son a short kiss,
then she shakes her head and murmurs, trembling:</p>

<p>"'No, it is not that! It is not that!'</p>

<p>"'Good-bye, Serge,' says his father.</p>

<p>"They shake hands, and give each other a
brief but hearty kiss.</p>

<p>"'You...' begins Serge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What's that?' asks his father in a jerky
voice.</p>

<p>"'No, not like that. No, no! What was
I going to say?' repeats his mother, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>"She was again seated, trembling.</p>

<p>"'You...' continues Serge.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, his face took on a pitiful expression,
and he made a grimace like a child. The
tears then came to his eyes.</p>

<p>"'Father, you are a strong man!'</p>

<p>"'What are you saying? What are you
saying?' the colonel cries, frightened.</p>

<p>"Then, as if he had been struck, the colonel's
head sank down upon his son's shoulder. And
they kissed each other, again and again, the
one with white hair and the other with the
prisoner's 'capote.'</p>

<p>"'And I?' a hoarse voice brusquely asked.</p>

<p>"They looked: the mother was standing,
her head thrown back, and she was watching
them with anger, almost hate.</p>

<p>"'What is the matter, dear?' cried the
colonel.</p>

<p>"'And I?' she repeated. 'You two kiss
each other, and I? You are men, aren't you?
And I?'</p>

<p>"'Mother!'</p>

<p>"And Serge threw himself into his mother's
arms....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"The last words of the colonel were:</p>

<p>"'I consecrate you to death, my boy! Die
with courage, like a soldier!'"</p>

<p>These few lines retrace one of the thousands
of daily dramas which compose modern Russian
history. The work of Andreyev brings to
us a sad vibrant echo of the sobs which ring
out in Russian dungeons. And this faithful
portrayal of events, events so frequent that
they no longer move us from our indifference,
when we find the echo of them in the press, will
raise in the conscience of Andreyev's readers a
cry of horror and pity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is principally in the dramas which he has
written in the last few years<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that Andreyev
has developed with most force and clearness his
favorite themes: the fear of living and dying,
the madness of believing in free-will, and the
nonsense of life, the weakness and vanity of
which he depicts for us.</p>

<p>The first of these works to appear was "The
Life of Man," which is a tragic illustration of
this pessimism.</p>

<p>When the curtain rises, "some one in grey,"
holding a torch, informs the audience that Man
is about to be born. From this time on, his life,
lighted like a lamp, will burn until death extinguishes
it. And Man will live, docile and
obedient to the orders that come to him from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
On-High, through the intermediary of this
"some one," whom he does not know. Each
act of the play represents a period in the life
of Man. In the first act, Man has acquired
riches and glory, and is found feasting with his
friends in his sumptuous home. The guests
are enchanted with their host, whom they envy.
But happiness is a fugitive shadow; it soon
betrays the man, who becomes poor, loses his
son, falls into the most abject misery, and dies
in a filthy and infected cellar, surrounded by
vile beggars, while the torch, held by "some
one in grey," begins to grow weaker, and then
dies out. And the man, conscious of his powerlessness
to conquer fate, and conscious of his
weakness in face of the mysterious "some one
in grey," confounds in the same malediction
God, Satan, Fatality, and Life, who have united
to annihilate him.</p>

<p>The themes of the "King of Famine" and
"Black Masks" offer a certain analogy to the
theme of "The Life of Man."</p>

<p>From the top of a belfry the "King of
Famine," in company with "Time" and
"Death," incites a workingmen's revolt. He
inspires them with an absolute certainty of victory,
although he can see that the revolt will
be quelled and the rebels crushed. Events do
not delay, in fact, to verify the prophecy of
the monarch. Locked up, the leaders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
revolt are condemned to death. The scene of
judgment in the last act is one of the finest in
the play. On one side are seated the sad and
dull judges; on the other, the elegant public,
which, with a feeling of fear and disgust, gazes
at the unfortunates whom the King of Famine
has robbed of almost all human semblance.
And in this play, also, Death reaps a bountiful
harvest.</p>

<p>"Black Masks" is the study of a pathological
case which Andreyev has dramatized
after the fashion of de Maupassant's "The
Horla."</p>

<p>The Duke Lorenzo, young, noble, and the
owner of a magnificent palace, is getting ready
to receive his guests, to whom he is giving, on
this evening, a masked ball. The masks arrive:
they are all black, and all look alike. They all
crowd around Lorenzo, whom this funereal sort
of masquerade bothers extremely. He cannot
find his wife among the guests. In fact, he
does not recognize any of them until, to cap
the climax, he meets his double, fights with him
and dies, without being able to discern who is
the real Lorenzo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At times, Andreyev tries to find the justification
of life, and looks for it in mysticism. He
then expounds a doctrine, according to which,
truth is individual and perhaps conceived by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
each man, thanks to direct intuition. Such is
the mystical truth which the author tries to
affirm in "Anathema."</p>

<p>The play opens with a scene between Anathema,
the incarnation of Satan, and "He who
guards the gates," behind which is the mystery
of eternity. Anathema entreats the Guardian
to give him access. But it is in vain that
Anathema flatters and insults him; finally,
Anathema declares that he will choose from
among mankind a poor Jew, named David
Leiser, will enrich him and, in order to prove
the absolute nonsense of life, will make this man
a living protestation against the work of Him
who knows all. Disguised as the lawyer Nullius,
Anathema comes down to earth and gives millions
to David. The latter, the best of men,
distributes his riches among the poor. But the
beggars become more and more numerous, and
soon David finds that he is as poor as he was
before the visit of Anathema.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the crowd of paupers, always
increasing, ask more money from David;
they demand miracles from this man, whose
goodness has made him a saint, a superman, in
their eyes. They bring him corpses and ask
him to resuscitate them. David flees; the
crowd follows and stones him to death. But,
through his love for his fellow-men, David has
acquired immortality, as "He who guards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
gates" tells Anathema, when, in the last act, the
evil archangel, beaten, returns to lie on the
threshold of the inconceivable mysterious.</p>

<p>This admirable play, born of a philosophical
conception which relates it to Goethe's
"Faust," has been received with particular
interest. Andreyev, in writing it, has come
very near to solving the question of the meaning
of life, and its justification. And, to the
person who ponders a while over this work, it
will appear that it is not Anathema who entreats
"Him who guards the gates" to reveal
the mystery, but it is Andreyev himself, who,
carried away by the force of his genius, has
thrown himself, as if at an invincible wall,
against this pitiless guardian, the guardian of
the solution of the enigma of life.</p>

<p>While "Anathema" is an abstract character,
whose form resembles more an algebraic
formula than a living process of human relations,
another of Andreyev's plays, "The Love
of the Student," written a short time before
"Anathema," gives us a little picture of customs,
alert and painted with the touch of a
master.</p>

<p>Gloukortzev, a young student, falls in love
with a young girl whom her mother forces to
become a prostitute. Gloukortzev, young and
inexperienced, has not the slightest suspicion,
till the young girl herself reveals to him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
horrible truth. And, perhaps for the first time
in his life, the gulf of necessity, toward which
fate drives men, opens before him. He sees
with horror that he cannot come to the rescue
of the girl he loves, because he is poor himself.
He cannot even buy her some food, when she
tells him that she has eaten nothing since the
night before. Placed before the absolute bare
reality of life, Gloukortzev does not know what
to do, and his comrades, good and upright fellows
like himself, have not the means to help
him.</p>

<p>Several very successful scenes, in which the
author blends the tragic with the comic, deserve,
in this brief analysis, special attention.
In the first act, there is a students' picnic at
which Olga and Gloukortzev, still full of happiness,
are present. The spectator is drawn by
personal sympathy to the student Onoufry, a
good fellow, always drunk, who makes fun of
others and himself. We see him again in the
second act, when Gloukortzev finds out about
Olga's life. The poignant scene between the
poor girl and her lover is heightened and softened
by the arrival of the students, to whom
Gloukortzev tells his sorrow. The last two acts
take place in Olga's home. The mother brings
her daughter a rich "client." And, in the
next room, Gloukortzev suffers terribly, because
he knows that his beloved is still leading an infamous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
life. In the same room, in the fourth
act, we are present at an orgy, during which
the student quarrels with an officer who has
come to spend the night with Olga. But Onoufry,
interfering in time, prevents an affray the
issue of which would probably have been fatal.
When the curtain falls, Gloukortzev, intoxicated,
is weeping; at his side is Olga, also
weeping, while Onoufry and the officer are singing:
"The days of our lives are as short as
the life of a wave."</p>

<p>This drama, as well as most of Andreyev's
plays, has been produced with great success
in Russia and also in Europe.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br />
DMITRY MEREZHKOVSKY</h2>


<p>Unlike Gorky, Andreyev, and Tchekoff,
Merezhkovsky was brought up in the midst of
comfort and elegance; he received a correct
and careful education; fate was solicitous for
him, in that it allowed him to develop that
spirit of objective observation and calm meditation
which permits a man to look down on the
spectacle of life, and indulge in philosophical
speculations very often divorced from reality.</p>

<p>The son of an official of the imperial court,
Merezhkovsky was born in St.&nbsp;Petersburg in
1865. In this city he received his entire education,
and here he gained the degree of bachelor
of letters in 1886.</p>

<p>He began his literary career with some poems
which won for him a certain renown. In 1888,
he published his first collection, and then a second
in 1892, "The Symbols." At the same
time, he published several translations from
Greek and Latin authors.</p>

<p>As he was a friend of the unfortunate Nadson,
and a pupil of the humanitarian Pleshcheyev,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Merezhkovsky wrote at first under the influence
of the liberal ideas of his early masters.
His verses, always harmonious, and a little
affected, soon belied this tendency and very
frankly revealed his preferences. In the first
collection of his poems, vibrant with generous
ideas, he proclaimed that he wanted, above all,
"the joy of life," and that a poet should not
have any other cult than that of beauty.</p>

<p>The poem called "Vera" was his first real
success. The extreme simplicity of the plot&mdash;the
unfortunate love of a young professor and
of a young weakly girl who dies of consumption
in the very flower of youth&mdash;and the
very faithful reproduction of the intellectual
life of Russia in 1880, give to this work the
importance of a document in some ways almost
historic.</p>

<p>This poem is like a last tribute paid by the
author to the humanitarian and realistic tendencies
of Russian literature. Afterward,
yielding to the inclinations of his nature and
his taste for classical antiquity, Merezhkovsky
insensibly changed. While acquiring, both in
prose and in verse, an incontestable mastery,
he could now look only for a cold and haughty
beauty which was sufficient unto itself. The
beginning was hard, but then all came easier.
After critical articles on the trend of modern
literature, he published "The Reprobate," a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
bold dithyrambic on ancient Greek philosophy.
The poetry that followed was clearly Epicurean
and in complete contradiction to the altruistic
tendencies of the neo-Christian period, which
found an arch enemy in Nietzsche, whose philosophy
evidently influenced Merezhkovsky.
However, this evolution did not have a very
favorable effect on his poetry; it bordered on
an art the clarity of which approached dryness,
while at the same time its lack of tenderness
reduced its symbolism to an artificial lyricism
or to lifeless allegories.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Merezhkovsky works with untiring constancy
to glorify antiquity. He has made excellent
translations of Sophocles, Euripides, and of
"Daphne and Chloe," that idyl of Longus that
charmed both Goethe and Catherine II. He
chooses the characters of his new poems from
Greek and Latin mythology, and from themes
inspired by an ardent love of paganism. He
has written three prose works of considerable
value: "The Death of the Gods," "The Resurrection
of the Gods,"<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and "Peter and
Alexis." The general idea of all of these is
the struggle between Greek polytheism and
Christianity, between Christ and Antichrist, to
use the author's expression, or, as Dostoyevsky
used to say, between the "man-God" and the
"God-man."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>This struggle touches upon the gravest
problem that can occupy the human mind, and
continually puts before us this perplexing question:
"Should the purpose of life be only the
search for happiness and beauty, or must we
admit, as a law of nature, the dogma of suffering
and death?" The former of these conceptions
found its supreme formula in Greek
paganism. The ultimate expansion of the latter
leads us, on the one hand, to faith,&mdash;to the
religion of sacrifice, and, on the other hand,
into the domain of philosophy,&mdash;to the destruction
of the desire to live, as conceived by
Schopenhauer. It is this struggle between the
two principles of Hellenic philosophy and Christian
faith that Merezhkovsky has tried to show
us by fixing, in his novels, the historic moments
when this struggle reached its greatest intensity;
and by making appear in these periods
the characters who, according to him, are most
typical and representative. For this reason he
has chosen to give his readers pictures of the
three epochs which he considers as culminating:
first, the last attempt made to restore the worship
of the gods a short time after the Emperor
Constantine had brought about their ruin; secondly,
the Renaissance, which, in spite of triumphant
Christianity, shows us a glorious renewal
of the arts and sciences of antiquity;
finally, the beginning of the 18th century, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
reign of Peter the Great, who tried to make a
place for the gods of antiquity in Russia, where
they were regarded with horror by the orthodox
clergy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his novel, "The Death of the Gods,"
Merezhkovsky has painted the first of these
epochs, the different phases of which revolve
about the principal hero, the emperor Julian
the Apostate. In "The Resurrection of the
Gods" he develops, in sumptuous frescoes, the
age of the Renaissance, personified by Leonardo
da Vinci, who best typifies the character
and tendencies of that time. In "Peter and
Alexis," he retraces Russian life in the beginning
of the 18th century, when it was dominated
by the extraordinary character of Peter
the Great.</p>

<p>Julian the Apostate was one of the last idolaters
of expiring paganism. But he could do
nothing against the infatuation of the masses
who were embracing the new religion, and it was
in vain that he employed both so much kindness
and so much violence in order to suppress Christianity.
The reign of the gods was irrevocably
ended. His soul filled with rage when he saw
that he was powerless to change the course of
events. He ended by undertaking a foolhardy
expedition into Persia, thinking that that was
the only way in which to defeat Christ, triumph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
over the "cursed" religion, and bring back
victoriously the altars of the dead gods. But
the Olympians on whom he had counted were of
no service to him. According to the Christian
legend, it was then, at the moment of death, that
he cried out: "Galilean, thou hast conquered!"
They say that he added: "Let the Galileans
conquer, for the victory will be ours, ... later.
The gods will come back ... we shall all be
gods."</p>

<p>This scene is one of the finest in the book.
Surrounded by some faithful friends, Julian
speaks, with his last breath, the words which
one of these friends, the historian Ammianus
Marcellinus, has recorded.</p>

<p>"His voice was low but clear. His whole
presence breathed forth intellectual triumph,
and from his eyes there still gleamed invincible
will. Ammianus's hand trembled as he wrote.
But he knew that he was writing on the tables
of history, and transmitting to future generations
the words of a great emperor:</p>

<p>"'Listen, friends; my hour is come, perhaps
too soon. But you see that I, like an
honest debtor, rejoice in giving back my life
to Nature, and feel in my soul neither pain nor
fear; nothing but cheerfulness, and a presentiment
of eternal repose.... I have done my
duty, and have nothing to repent. From the
days when, like a hunted animal, I awaited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
death in the palace of Marcellum, in Cappadocia,
up to the time when I assumed the purple
of the Roman C&aelig;sars, I have tried to keep my
soul spotless. If I have failed to do all that I
desired, do not forget that our earthly deeds
are in the hands of Fate. And now I thank the
Eternal Ruler for having allowed me to die,
not after a long sickness nor at the hands of
an executioner, but on the battlefield, in full
youth, with work ahead of me still to be done....
And, my dear friends, tell both my friends
and my enemies, how the Hellenes, endowed with
divine wisdom, can die....'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Revenge for the dying emperor was long in
coming. But now, after eleven centuries, the
prophecy of Julian is accomplished: heroic antiquity,
everlastingly young, arises from the
grave. On all sides the gods are resurrected.
Their marble effigies, so long buried, reappear.
Both the powerful and the humble receive them
with enthusiasm and rejoice at seeing them. It
is an irresistible outburst which carries with it
all classes of the Italian people. Like a wind-blown
flame, Greek genius inspires a new life
in the world. But, while a sweeter and more
humane moral feeling tries to liberalize the
church, the sombre voice of Savonarola, hardened
by the terrible corruption of manners,
mounts ever more menacingly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Italy! oh, Rome! I am going to deliver
you up into the hands of a people who will
efface you from among the nations. I see them,
the enemies who descend like hungry tigers....
Florence, what have you done? Do you
want me to tell you? Your iniquity has heaped
up the measure; prepare for a terrible plague!
Oh, Lord, thou art witness that I tried to keep
off this crumbling ruin from my brothers; but
I can do no more, my strength is failing me. Do
not sleep, oh, Lord! Dost Thou not see that
we are becoming a shame to the world? How
many times we have called to Thee! How many
tears we have shed! Where is Thy providence?
Where is Thy goodness? Where is Thy fidelity?
Stretch forth Thy helping hand to us!"</p>

<p>And thus the antagonism between the "God-man"
and the "man-God" of Hellenic paganism
expresses itself more strongly than ever before.</p>

<p>The picture of the Renaissance that Merezhkovsky
paints for us is very full, very rich, at
times even a little overburdened with episodes
and people. One constantly rubs shoulders
with Leonardo da Vinci, the duchess Beatrice
of Este, regent of Milan, the favorite Lucrecia
Crivelli, the mysterious Gioconda, Charles VIII,
Louis XII and Francis I, kings of France, and
also with C&aelig;sar Borgia; we find here the
preaching of Savonarola, the death of the pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Alexander VI (Borgia), Marshal Trivulce, the
triumphal entry of the French into Milan, the
diplomacy of Niccolo <a class="corr" name="TC_6" id="TC_6" title="and "> </a>Machiavelli. In
fact, as has been said above, there are too many
events and characters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two centuries go by and now we come to the
third novel, "Peter and Alexis." The scene is
in Russia, and the hero is Peter the Great, whom
Merezhkovsky represents as a worshipper of
things Olympian. He gives a magnificent description
of the orgies held by the emperor in
honor of Bacchus and Venus, especially the
latter, whose statue he expressly ordered from
Rome and installed in the Summer Garden at
St.&nbsp;Petersburg.</p>

<p>In a veritable fairyland of avenues, of yoke-elms
and flower-beds in geometric designs, of
enormous baskets filled with the choicest flowers,
of straight canals, of ponds, of islets, of magnificent
fountains, such a fairyland as Watteau
would have dreamed of, there is a Venetian
f&ecirc;te with all sorts of fire-works and illuminations;
small crafts, adorned with flags, are filled
with men in golden garments, girded with
swords, and wearing three-cornered hats and
buckled shoes; and the women are dressed in
velvet and covered with jewels.</p>

<p>The Tsar himself opens the case, and helps in
placing the goddess on her pedestal. Again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
as two hundred years before in Florence, the
resurrected goddess, Aphrodite, emerges from
the grave. The cords stretch, the pulleys creak;
she rises higher and higher. Peter is almost
of the same superhuman height as the statue.
And his face, close to that of Aphrodite, remains
noble: the man is worthy of the goddess....</p>

<p>"The Immortal One&mdash;Aphrodite&mdash;was
still the same that she was on the hillside in
Florence; she had progressed further and
further, from age to age, from people to people,
halting nowhere, till in her victorious march she
had reached the very ends of the earth, the
Hyperborean Scythia, beyond which there is
naught but darkness and death...."</p>

<p>But what miseries this magnificent fa&ccedil;ade
conceals! Not far off, on an island in the river,
one can see people who are watching the f&ecirc;te
and who think that they are present at one of
the spectacles forerunning doomsday. Among
the crowd are seen the "raskolnik" Cornelius,
old Vitalya of the "runners," deserters, the
merchant Ivanov, the clerk Dokounine ...
and several others. In the few remarks that
they exchange, we can see that, for them, Peter
the Great is the Antichrist, "the beast announced
by the Gospel."</p>

<p>Such is the tie that binds Peter the Great,
Julian, and Leonardo together. But this tie is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
weakened by the fact that Peter, an essentially
practical and utilitarian genius, was not the
man to become inspired with Hellenic poetry,
and if the author introduces the Tsar into the
society of Julian the Apostate and of Leonardo
da Vinci, it is because Peter the Great was one
of those indefatigable strugglers, who, to attain
their ends, put themselves above the obligations
of ordinary morality, one of those supermen,
who hesitate at nothing in satisfying the instincts
of their egoisms, of their dominating
wills. In fact, the heroes of Merezhkovsky's
novels all belong in the category of the Nietzschean
type of superman, which explains their
philosophical relationship and the sort of trilogy
which these three novels form. Thus,
Julian the Apostate, who tried in vain during
his life to make history repeat itself, by transplanting
pagan traditions into a plot which had
become unfit to receive them, and who died in
the effort to preserve a faith&mdash;does not this
man, then, incarnate that implacable pursuit
of the "integral personality" so extolled by
Nietzsche? Leonardo da Vinci, that great universal
and keen mind, who gave himself over
to all the impulses of his creative genius, not
caring whether the impulses are worthy or
harmful, appears as a luminous manifestation
of that state of the soul "beyond good and
bad" which characterizes the superman. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
is not Peter the Great also a veritable superman;
a man who, through his iron will, upset all the
ancient institutions of aged Russia, and who
did not even prevent the assassination of his
son Alexis, inasmuch as he thought that it was
for the good of his country?</p>

<p>At all events, the interest and value of "Peter
and Alexis" does not rest in its philosophic
ideas and in the Nietzschean obsession, but
rather in the art with which Merezhkovsky
faithfully depicts the psychology of his heroes.
The successive phases of this terrible tragedy
lead up to a striking climax, and set off, one
against the other, temperaments so entirely opposed
that the reciprocal tenderness of the
father and son is transformed finally into suspicion
and hate, and the father resolves to sacrifice
the life of his son to what appears to him
to be the right of the State. The novel, although
a little overburdened with details, is an
excellent analysis of the customs of the Russia
of former times.</p>

<p>The source of the struggle between Peter
and Alexis was known. Peter represented the
West and the new ideas, while Alexis represented
the Russia of old, rebellious to innovations
which she considered dangerous. The author
thus symbolizes the eternal conflict between the
past and the future. He has analyzed with
consummate art the characters of his two heroes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Peter is a man full of contrasts; he is, like
many Russians, "a brute and a child," by turns
violent and gentle, knavish and simple, cruel
and kind, practical and mystical, proud and
modest. Possessed of a prodigious activity, he
conceives tremendous projects which he immediately
wants to put into execution, inspecting
everything, verifying everything, finding
no care beneath his dignity, talking to the
workingmen as if he were one of them, not
making long speeches, and fiercely, with cries
of rage, fighting dishonest contractors and
tradesmen.</p>

<p>Set over against this irascible father, endowed
with herculean strength, the Tsarevich
Alexis, thin, pale, and delicate, makes a sad
figure. Most historians, following the example
of Voltaire, have represented this prince as a
narrow-minded person, a victim of the bigoted
and intolerant education of the clergy.
Merezhkovsky, a more discreet psychologist,
does not rely on these superficial data, but
shades the portrait admirably. He makes
Alexis an intelligent man, not like his father,
but a man with a comprehensive, subtle spirit.
He probably was crushed by the powerful individuality
of his father. As he is closely in
touch with the people, and knows their aspirations,
Alexis judges the work of his father with
delicate insight: "My father hopes," he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
"to do everything in a great hurry. One, two,
three, and the affair is settled. He does not
realize that things done hastily do not
last...."</p>

<p>While Peter is aware of his unpopularity,
his son is loved by the townspeople, the peasants,
and the clergy. They say that, "Alexis
is a man who seeks God and who does not want
to upset everything: he is the hope of the
nation."</p>

<p>What the author has best shown in this novel
is the degree to which the high society of this
time was, under its exterior gorgeousness, barbarous
and vulgar. A German girl, maid-of-honor
to the wife of Alexis, defines it in the
following way: "Brandy, blood, coarseness. It
is hard to say which is most prominent,&mdash;perhaps
it is coarseness." The boyards<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> she describes
as: "Impudent savages, baptized bears,
who only make themselves more ridiculous when
they try to ape the Europeans."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As is evident, these three works of Merezhkovsky
belong to the "genre" of the historical
and philosophical novel which demands, besides
the power to call up past ages, a careful education
and the gift of clear-sightedness. And the
novelist completely fulfills these requirements.
He knows his subject, he studies all the necessary
documents with the greatest care and follows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
every story to its source; finally, before
taking up his pen, he visits the countries and
the cities in which the stories take place. Thus,
in order better to understand Leonardo da
Vinci, in order to live his life, the author of
"The Resurrection of the Gods" traversed
Italy and France from one end to the other, in
the same way that he had traveled all over
Greece so that he could give us a more life-like
Julian. With the same care, he spent a long
time reading Russian historical documents in
order to present the reader with a better picture
of the customs of the time of Peter the Great.
The result is a series of historical pictures, almost
perfect in their accuracy. If Merezhkovsky
had no other merit than this faithful
portrayal of the past, his novels even then
would be read with interest and pleasure.</p>

<p>Some critics have remarked that the most
glaring defect in his books lies in their construction.
His novels often disregard the laws
relating to this sort of literature, which demand
the clever grouping of the characters and events
around a principal hero. It is true that this
unity and the sense of proportion absolutely
necessary for any sort of harmony are not to
be found in his works. The details predominate
to the detriment of important facts; the people
of secondary importance are sometimes drawn
better than the heroes themselves, whose adventures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
are entirely unconnected. There is a
series of jumps from one situation to another,
with gaps and interruptions of considerable
length, which break the chain of events. It is
for this reason that, instead of seeing a historical
fresco, we see a whole gallery of sketches,
executed with subtle artistry, but insufficiently
connected with the main action of the drama.</p>

<p>These observations apply especially to the
first attempt of the young author: "The Death
of the Gods"; "The Resurrection of the
Gods" and "Peter and Alexis" are more skilfully
composed. They indicate a stronger
tendency towards unity; one feels that an infinitely
firmer and more experienced brush has
been used; the colors are richer and they do
not suffer from that monotony of effect and
of color so noticeable in "The Death of the
Gods," where the author too often uses the same
devices. As to the characters of Leonardo da
Vinci and Peter the Great, they are very carefully
worked out, and the events in the lives
of the Italian master and the Russian Tsar are
narrated with magnificent psychological analysis,
which forces the reader to sympathize with
the heroes even more than he would naturally.</p>

<p>Merezhkovsky has also been accused of being
over-educated. The innumerable documents
presented do not bear closely enough upon the
action, the result being that many of his pages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
read like mere annals. They interest the reader
but do not move him. This is one reason why
some critics, essentially different in spirit from
Merezhkovsky, have believed themselves right
in denying that he has any talent. But this
accusation falls of itself in the face of the
power of the inspiration which pervades his
work, and the dramatic sense which he displays
in setting forth the events and personages. It
is impossible, for instance, to read without the
deepest emotion the story of the last days of
Leonardo da Vinci, where the author establishes
the tragic contrast between the outward signs
of glory, the superficial honors with which this
genius is overwhelmed, and the moral solitude
which afflicts him to the very end, which comes
when he is among people who are strangers to
his soul. All the childhood recollections of this
same Da Vinci are full of charm. There is a
veritable master spirit shown in the chapters
in which the author portrays for us the enigmatic
and seductive Mona Lisa. Finally, he
has given us a relief of rare energy in the terrible
struggle between Peter and Alexis, between
the man of iron whom nothing can affect
and his son, kind and timid, who, while having
a mortal fear of his father, still loves him. As
to certain pages, like those which describe the
strange inner life of the Tsarina Marfa Matveyevna,
"living by the light of candles, in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
old house savouring of the oil of night-lamps,
the dust and the putrification of centuries,"
these pages are a veritable tour de force if only
because of the plasticity and richness of the
author's vocabulary.</p>

<p>Finally, what tragic horror there is in the
supreme struggle where the emperor, the assassin
of his son, sees his isolation and feels his
weakness, "like a large deer gnawed at by flies
and lice until the blood runs!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides his novels Merezhkovsky has published
several essays, on Pushkin, Maykov,
Korolenko, Calderon, the French neo-romanticists,
Ibsen and others.... The most important
of all are: "The Causes of the Decadence
of Modern Russian Literature" and
"Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky." He reveals here
a fine and penetrating power of observation,
which, however, is often obscured because of
his obsession by Nietzschean ideas. Moreover,
he does not hide his antipathy to the people
whose literary tastes and ideas differ from his.
From this characteristic comes strange exaggerations
and a somewhat limited appreciation
of men and events. An example of this, for
instance, is the impression that he gives in his
study of the causes of the decadence of modern
Russian literature, the subject of which imposes
upon the author the double task of looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
up the causes of this decadence and also
proving that it exists. He has not succeeded.
In fact, it appears that this idea of decadence
exists only in the minds of the author and of a
small circle of writers who have the same ideas
about the mission of literature. Merezhkovsky
is absolutely right in all that he says about the
fact that Russian writers live solitary, deprived
of that precious excitation which is felt when
one is in contact with original and different
temperaments; but if you add to this, as he
has done, the statement that Russia does not
possess a literature worthy of the name, you
go too far. Without being a great scholar, it
is easy to perceive that our contemporary Russian
authors are legitimate sons of Turgenev,
Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, and grandsons of
Gogol, who himself is closely related to Pushkin.
A democratic and humanitarian realism&mdash;widely
separated from the Nietzscheism of
Merezhkovsky&mdash;strongly characterizes the
Russian lineage.</p>

<p>In his book on Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky he
spends a long time in differentiating between
the artistic intuition of these two great masters,
who are, according to him, the most profound
expression of the popular and higher element
of Russian culture.</p>

<p>What strikes him first in Tolstoy is the insistence
with which he describes "animal man."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
In a kind of "leitmotiv" Merezhkovsky has
shown us the Tolstoyan characters individualized
by very particular corporal signs.
"Tolstoy," he says, "has, to the very highest
degree, the gift of clairvoyance of the flesh;
even when dead, the flesh has a tongue." He
is the subtle painter of all sensations and he is
a master in this domain. But his art diminishes
singularly, and even disappears when he tries
to analyze the soul within the flesh. Dostoyevsky,
on the other hand, triumphs in his dialogue;
one sees his characters because one
shares all their sadness, their passions, their
intelligence, and their sensibility. Dostoyevsky
is the painter of the depths of the human soul,
which he portrays with almost supernatural
acuteness. And, as Tolstoy is "the seer of the
flesh," so is Dostoyevsky "the seer of the soul."</p>

<p>Having established this difference in principle,
Merezhkovsky, by constant deduction,
concludes, in consonance with his favorite idea,
that Tolstoy personifies "the pagan spirit" at
its height, while Dostoyevsky represents "the
Christian spirit." There is a great deal of fine
drawn reasoning in all of this, some very original
ideas, but a great many paradoxes. Even
the very personality of Tolstoy, the analysis
of which occupies a large part of the book, is
belittled in the hands of Merezhkovsky. Instead
of a noble character, one sees a very vain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
person, preoccupied only with himself. It is in
this simple way that Merezhkovsky explains the
moral evolution which led Tolstoy to make those
long and sad studies of a kind of life compatible
with the true good of humanity, and forced him
to them by "the anguish of the black mystery
of death" which, having got possession of the
author of "Anna <a class="corr" name="TC_7" id="TC_7" title="Karenin">Karenina</a>" in his sixtieth year,
in the midst of a life of prosperity, made him
hate his fortune and his comfort, which formerly
had been so dear to him. In the refusal of
Tolstoy to "bow to the great authorities of
the literary world, such as &AElig;schylus, Dante,
and Shakespeare," a refusal which is only the
logical consequence of his ideas on the principle
and purpose of art, Merezhkovsky can
only see a lack of general culture. Finally,
the sort of life he led toward the end of his
days came only "from the desire to know and
taste the pleasure of simplicity in all its subtleties."
"The admirable Epicurus," says Merezhkovsky,
"that joyous sage, who, in the very
center of Athens, cultivated with his own hands
a tiny garden, and taught men not to believe
in any human or divine chimeras, but to be contented
with the simple happiness that can be
given by a single sunbeam, a flower, a sup of
water from an earthen cup, or the summer
time, would recognize in Tolstoy his faithful
disciple, the only one, perhaps, who survives in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
this barbaric silence, where American comfort,
a mixture of effeminacy and indigence, has
made one forget the real purpose of life...."</p>

<p>In writing these lines, Merezhkovsky must
have forgotten that Tolstoy, in proclaiming his
ideas on religion and humanity, prepared himself,
not for Epicurean pleasures, but for seclusion
in one of the terrible dungeons of a
Russian monastery (now in disuse) under the
persecutions of a temporal and secular authority,
and it was not his fault that, by a sort of
miracle, he escaped this fate.</p>

<p>Dostoyevsky's life is the exact opposite of
Tolstoy's. The story of Dostoyevsky's terrible
existence is probably known. Born in an alms-house,
he never ceased to suffer, and to love....
It is hard to think of two people more
absolutely different than Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky.
But Merezhkovsky loves violent contrasts;
in the sharp difference between these
two writers, he sees the permanent union of
two controlling ideas of the Russian Renaissance
and the imminence of a final sympathy,
symbolic of a concluding harmony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have, by turns, studied Merezhkovsky
as a poet, a novelist, and a critic. The greatest
merit of his literary personality rests in
the perfect art with which he calls up the past.</p>

<p>But Merezhkovsky is not only an artist. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
we have noted, his novels have, as their end,
one of the greatest contradictions of human
life,&mdash;the synthesis of the voluptuous representations
of the religion of classical antiquity
and the moral principles of Christianity. It
is, therefore, natural to ask whether he has in
any way approached his goal and just where
he sees the salvation of humanity, the present
situation of which seems to him desperate. The
answer to this question can be found in his book,
"Ham Triumphant."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Our study of Merezhkovsky's
literary character would be incomplete
if the ideas of this book were not set
forth.</p>

<p>According to Merezhkovsky, the present evil
in the world consists entirely in the moral void
which results from the disappearance of the
Christian ideal from the soul. The loss of this
ideal was inevitable, and even productive of
good, because it had been so mutilated and deformed
by the Church, that Christian religion
became a symbol of the reaction, and its God
synonymous with executioner. Humanity will
rid itself of Christianity. But nothing will
replace it, unless it be the philosophy of positivism,
a sort of material religion of the appetites
and the senses, which gives no answer to
our anguish and our mystical instincts. This
philosophy presided at the formation of a
miserable society, an egotistical and mediocre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
bourgeoisie, who have no spiritual tendencies,
and are incapable of sacrificing themselves to
any ideal other than that of money.</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill said that the bourgeoisie
would transform Europe into a
China; the Russian publicist Hertzen, frightened
by the victories of socialism, in 1848,
foresaw the end of European civilization,
drowned in a wave of blood. Merezhkovsky affirms
that the Chinese and the Japanese, being
the most complete and the most persevering
representatives of this "terrestrial" religion,
will without fail conquer Europe, where positivism
still bears some traces of Christian romanticism.
"The Chinese," he says, "are perfect
positivists, while the Europeans are not yet
perfect Chinese, and, in this respect, the Americans
are perfect Europeans." Where is one
to look for safety against this heavy load on
the understanding and this future humiliation?
In socialism, one says. But socialism, if it
is not yet bourgeois, is almost so. "The
starved proletariat and the rejected bourgeois
have different economic opinions," says
Merezhkovsky, "but their ideal is the same,
the pursuit of happiness." As it is but a step
from the prudence of the bourgeois to the
exasperated state of the starved proletariat,
this pursuit can lead to nothing else but international
atrocities of militarism and chauvinism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Progress having become the sole ambition
of the cultivated barbarians, satiety became
their religion, and the only hope of escaping
from this barbarism was to adopt the
religion of love, founded by Jesus. Jesus said
to those who were treated with violence, and
who, in turn, had used violence in trying to free
themselves: "Truth (love) will set you free."
These words, which identify truth with love,
contain in themselves the profoundest social
and personal morality. They inspired the first
martyrs of Christianity; but in time they were
forgotten by the Church. Succumbing to the
"diabolical seduction of power," religion itself
became a power, an autocracy; people submitted
to this power, and thus the Byzantine
and Russian orthodoxy came into existence. In
this manner, the morals of the government, antichristian
in essence, became the doctrine of
Christianity; and the particular morals of the
latter became transformed into a mysterious
gospel of life, relegating its aspirations to an
existence beyond the tomb. Now there is nothing
for Christianity to do but return to its first
sources and develop the principles of universal
religion found there. One should no longer be
concerned with heavenly and personal advantage,
but with earthly affairs and social conditions;
instead of being conquered by the government
one should conquer it, permeate it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
one's spirit, and thus realize the prophecy in
the Apocalypse of the millennium of the saints
on earth, and destroy the forms of the power of
the government, the laws, and the empire.
Such a renewal of Christianity demands an energetic
struggle, self-forgetfulness, and martyrs.
But where is one to find the necessary
forces? Merezhkovsky does not see them in the
States of western Europe, because the "intellectuals"
there are antichristians and are
congealed in their bourgeois positivism.
"Above these Christian states, above these old
Gothic stores," says Merezhkovsky, "rises,
here and there, a Protestant wooden cross, half
rotted; or a Catholic one of iron, all rusted,
and no one pays any attention to them." What
purity and nobility remains can manifest itself
only in certain scattered individuals, in such
great hermits as Nietzsche, Ibsen, Flaubert,
Goethe in his old age; they are like deep artesian
wells which prove that, beneath the arid
earth there is still some flowing water. There
is nothing of this sort in Russia. Although
backward from the point of view of progress
and politics, this country produced the "intellectuals"
who form something unique in our
present civilization: in essence, they are anti-bourgeois.
"The positivism which the Russian
'intellectuals' have adopted by way of
imitation is rejected by their feelings, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
conscience, and their will; it is an artificial
monument that is set up in their minds only."</p>

<p>Merezhkovsky, then, has reason for thinking
that the social renovation of Christianity will
be accomplished in Russia. And as this work
is the especial concern of the clergy, Merezhkovsky,
who several years ago was present at
a meeting where the Russian priests affirmed
their desire to free themselves from the yoke
of their religious and secular chiefs, proposed
to accomplish this great mission. "It is indispensable,"
he says, "for the Russian Church
to untie the knots that bind it to the decayed
forms of the autocracy, to unite itself to the
'intellectuals' and to take an active part in the
struggle for the great political and social deliverance
of Russia. The Church should not
think of its own liberty at present, but of martyrdom."</p>

<p>We will not criticize these, perhaps illusory,
ideas and previsions of Merezhkovsky. Russian
life has become an enigma; who knows to
what moral crisis the social conscience may be
led by the present political crisis? Merezhkovsky's
Olympian &aelig;sthetics have made him a foreigner
in Russian literature. Yet as soon as
the tempest burst forth, certain familiar traits
showed themselves, traits common to the best
Russian writers and to the general spirit of
Russian literature. In his absolute, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
exaggerated, distaste for "bourgeoisisme," and
his desire for an ideal, he is a legitimate son of
this literature. The nature of his ideas is in
harmony with those we have already found in
Tolstoy, with his gospel of Christian anarchism,
in Dostoyevsky, with his ideas about the "omni-humanity"
of the Russian spirit, in Vladimir
Solovyev, with his idea of universal theocracy,
and, finally, in Chadayev, one of the most remarkable
thinkers of the first half of the last
century, who, although now almost forgotten,
was the real source of all these ideas.</p>

<p>Thus in the conception of socialized Christianity
Merezhkovsky seeks the end of the great
antithesis between the "God-man" and the
"man-God," between Christ and Bacchus, an
antithesis which makes the generality of men
often conduct themselves after the manner of
that German petty kingdom, of which Heine
speaks, where the people, while venerating
Christ, do not forget to honor Bacchus by
abundant libations. Merezhkovsky's idea
ought to appear in the form of a synthetic
fusion of the joyous religion of Greece and
the religion of love, as taught by Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
ALEXANDER KUPRIN</h2>


<p>The work of Kuprin contrasts strongly with
the writings of his predecessors and of his
contemporaries. It would be useless to try to
connect him with Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, or
Gorky. This does not mean that he came under
foreign influence. As a matter of fact his
work clearly shows the imprint of Slavic genius
and receives its richness from qualities which
have always appeared in Slavic literature,&mdash;sincerity
and accuracy of observation, a passionate
love for all manifestations of modern
life, lyrical fullness, and power of suggestion.
But Alexander Kuprin does not depict adepts
of the "religion of pity," nor the psychology
of the abnormal, the "pathological case," so
curious and rare, and so dear to the author of
"Crime and Punishment."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He does not reincarnate
the sad genius of Korolenko. He is
equally separated from Tolstoy and Gorky.
He is himself. That is to say, he is an exquisite
story-teller, profound and touching,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
who imposes neither thesis nor moral upon his
reader, but paints life as it appears to him,&mdash;not
seen through the medium of a temperament,&mdash;but
in all sincerity, without too much ardor
or too much indifference.</p>

<p>This author was born in 1870. After having
attended the Cadet School and the Military
School at Moscow, he entered military service
as an active lieutenant in 1890, but resigned
seven years later in order to devote his time to
literature. Before this, he had published several
stories.</p>

<p>In spite of the undeniable talent which is
found in his earlier writings, the public hesitated
to praise him. Certain lucky circumstances,
however, favored the beginning of his
work. One of his relatives, at the start, offered
him a position on a magazine which she
was then editing. This was a wonderful opportunity
for him, for usually at his age the
more gifted writers are still groping around
for light. But merit alone seldom suffices to
form the basis of literary fame. Scandal is
often necessary to consecrate, as one might say,
a growing reputation. Kuprin, without seeking
to start a scandal, did so, in spite of himself,
when he published "The Duel," a study of
military life, in which he showed the most absolute
impartiality.</p>

<p>To his great surprise, the public accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
this book as a new indictment of the army. It
was because the Manchurian campaign was so
recent. Every portrayal of military life
passed as a violent satire on the corrupt and
disgraced army. Kuprin in vain tried to
change this unexpected judgment. As he was
an ardent partisan of the theory of "art for
art's sake," he could not allow a purpose to be
attributed to his work. He had only faithfully
portrayed what he had witnessed in the course
of his brief career. But in order to strengthen
his defence, he alleged reasons which could not
be understood in an altruistic country. Besides,
several of his stories, such as, "The
Wedding," full of the dissolute life led by the
officers in their garrisons, "The Inquest,"
where the author shows the violences to which
the Russian soldiers are subjected, "The
Night's Lodging," and "The Ensign of
the Army," which stigmatize certain lace-bedecked
"Lovelaces," only help to nullify his
best arguments. In short, his fame spread
rapidly and the young writer had to accept the
renown that became his.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From that time on Kuprin's road was
mapped out. According to the dictates of his
fancy he depicts thousands of the ever-changing,
different aspects of life. He is equally
impelled to write about petty tradesmen, actors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
acrobats, and sinners in the Crimea. To the
accomplishment of his task, he brings an over-minute
and cruel observation. With the genius
that is his he dwells on certain important, carefully
selected traits of people who live intensely.</p>

<p>In "The Disciple," we see a young sharper
on a boat on the Volga. He has the tired eyes
of a precocious old man, stubby fingers, and
the hands of a murderer alert to strike the
fatal blow. He has just fleeced a party of
travelers, and he discovers, in a savory conversation
with an old cheat, who has found him
out, that his soul is being consumed with insatiable
desires. And as the old sharper admires
the "savoir-faire" of his young friend,
the latter observes, not without scorn, that they
belong to two very different categories of
sharpers. "Among you old fellows," he sneers,
"there was romanticism. You loved beautiful
women, champagne, music and the song of the
tziganes.... We, however, we others are
tired of everything. Fear and debauch are
equally unknown to us...."</p>

<p>After the sharper we have the spy in "Captain
Rybnikov." He passes for a Siberian, and
says that he has been wounded in the Russo-Japanese
war. He goes out into society a
great deal, and is most commonly seen in the
military offices and in the best "salons" of St.&nbsp;Petersburg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
One night, when he is asleep at a
courtesan's house, he mutters the war-cry of
Japan: "Banzai! Banzai!" The courtesan denounces
him to a policeman who happens to be
there, and the pseudo-captain, who is no other
than a colonel in the Japanese army, is arrested.</p>

<p>Before leaving the military world, let us
analyze "The Delirium." Captain Markov
has been ordered by the government to suppress
the revolution in certain provinces. Disgusted
with the duty of daily executioner, the
officer frets himself into a high fever. A non-commissioned
officer enters to ask him to decide
the fate of three men who have been arrested
the previous night, one of whom is an old man
with a peaceful and strangely beautiful face.
The sergeant knows that they ought to be shot,
but these executions are so repulsive to him,
that he is anxious to have the sentence of death
confirmed by his chief, who seems to him to have
the sole responsibility.</p>

<p>"I don't want you ever again to ask me
such a question," cries Markov, who has guessed
the intention of his subordinate. "You know
what you ought to do." And he dismisses him.
But the soldier remains motionless.</p>

<p>"What else do you want?" asks the captain.</p>

<p>"The men," answers the stubborn soldier,
"are anxious to know what to do with the ...
old ... man...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get out of here!" the officer roars, exasperated.
"Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Very well, captain. But as to-day is December
31, allow me to offer you my best wishes
for a happy New Year."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," replies Markov in
a voice which has suddenly become soft.</p>

<p>During the night the captain begins to rave.
The old man whom he has just condemned to
death appears and speaks to him. He says
that his name is Cain, and confesses the murder
of his brother. Cursed by God, he wanders
disconsolately through the centuries, followed
by the groaning of his victim.</p>

<p>Just before dawn the sergeant awakens
Markov.</p>

<p>"What about those three men?" asks the
captain eagerly.</p>

<p>"Shot, captain!"</p>

<p>"And the old man? The old man?...
what have you done with him?"</p>

<p>"We shot him along with the others, captain."</p>

<p>The next day Captain Markov asks for his
discharge, having decided to leave the army for
good.</p>

<p>This story, which is one of the most powerful
in Russian literature, would have been enough
to bring the young writer renown, even if he
had never written anything else. But his work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
which is already imposing in amount, abounds
in pages of great merit, and especially in well-constructed,
brief, tragic stories.</p>

<p>Under this class should be mentioned
"Humble People," a short story, the scene of
which is laid in the extreme north. It is the
story of a close friendship between a nurse in
a dispensary and a school-teacher.</p>

<p>Snowed in by a terrible winter&mdash;a winter of
seven months&mdash;these two friends find in their
daily meetings the only pleasure that can make
their enforced solitude easier for them. However,
in spite of their mutual friendship, they
often find their lot hard to endure. And they
continually quarrel, only to become reconciled
almost immediately. But now an unexpected
event comes to break the monotony of their
existence. They are invited to a dance, given
by the priest of the neighboring village, and
there they fall in love with two charming young
girls, who, they are happy to find, are not indifferent
to them. Once at home, they bestow
lavish praises on their new friends. With the
touching devotion of simple and starved hearts
they speak about them as if the young girls already
were theirs.</p>

<p>"Mine has eyes of velvet," says the one.</p>

<p>"And mine has hair of pure gold," replies
the other.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, their recollections grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
weaker, and fade, just as flowers do. Their
sad life would have begun again if the spring
had not come, and with it brought deliverance.
The two friends, full of new sprightliness, get
up a fishing party one day. A foolish accident
makes them both fall into the river, and they
are drowned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The End of a Story," which we are about
to analyze, deserves, as does "Humble People,"
a special place in the work of Kuprin. It is a
little masterpiece of graceful emotion.</p>

<p>Kotik, a child of seven, and the son of a
celebrated painter, teases his father to tell
him a story. The father racks his memory.
He has told so many that his fount is almost
dry.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea comes to him. Is not his
own life a tender, melancholy, and charming
story? It is not a long time, twelve years at
the most, since he was a poor, obscure painter,
neglected by his masters and tormented by the
miseries of his life. Discouraged, he used continually
to curse the hour in which he chose to
devote himself to art. One day, a young girl,
believing in his talent, gave him her hand and
comforted him with her tenderness and angelic
goodness. And love had triumphed.</p>

<p>To-day his name is celebrated among the
most famous, and his paintings adorn the galleries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of kings and emperors. The plot of the
story is ready.</p>

<p>"Listen," says the father to his son. "There
was once upon a time a king who, feeling that
he was going to die, gathered his many children
about him and said to them: 'I will leave
my kingdom to that one of you who can enter
a marble palace situated in a very dense forest,
and there light his torch from the sacred fire
which always burns there. The forest is full
of wild beasts and venomous serpents. The
palace is guarded by three lions: Envy, Poverty,
and Doubt.'</p>

<p>"The young people set out on the road.
But, while the older ones search outside of the
forest for a road that is not beset with dangers,
the youngest courageously starts on the regular
path. He there is exposed to many dangers
and temptations. Already, his strength failing,
he feels that he is almost on the point of
succumbing, when a fairy appears and stretches
forth her hand to him. The young man blesses
this providential aid. The fairy brings back
his courage and leads him to the palace."</p>

<p>Near them on the terrace, concealed by some
plants, there sat a young and beautiful woman
who was eagerly listening to the story. She
was Kotik's mother, the fairy of the story, and
the favorite pupil of the painter. Some of her
paintings had already made a sensation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The story ended, the father led the child to
his room and with the help of his nurse undressed
him and put him to bed.</p>

<p>"He had started back towards the terrace,
when suddenly two arms embraced his
neck, while two sweet lips pressed against
his.</p>

<p>"The story was finished."</p>

<p>With these words the story really ends.</p>

<p>Kuprin shows the same grace and the same
delicate emotion in his recent story, "The Garnet
Necklace," a tale which is analogous to the
legend of the troubadour Geoffrey Rudel, which
has been made into a play by Rostand in his
"Princesse Lointaine."</p>

<p>Geltov, a Russian petty official, loves the
beautiful Princess She&iuml;ne with a desperate love.
After long hesitation he decides to send her a
garnet necklace, with a tender and respectful
note enclosed. Alas! his gift is returned to
him and the husband of the princess angrily
threatens the na&iuml;ve lover. The latter has not
the strength to face the situation, and commits
suicide. But before dying he writes to the
princess:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I saw you for the first time eight years ago
in a theatre, and since that time I have loved
you with boundless passion. It is not my fault,
Princess, that God has sent this great happiness
to me.... My life for the last eight years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
has been bound up in one thought,&mdash;you. Believe
what I say, believe me because I am going
to die.... I am neither a sick man nor an
enthusiast.... I consider my love for you
as the greatest happiness that God could have
given me.... This happiness I have enjoyed
for eight years. May God give you happiness,
and may nothing henceforth trouble
you...."</p>

<p>This na&iuml;ve and touching letter moves the
princess. At the grave of her unhappy lover,
she recalls the words of an old friend of her
father's: "Perhaps he was an abnormal man or
a maniac.... Perhaps,&mdash;who knows?&mdash;your
life was illumined by a love of which
women often dream, a kind of love that one
does not see nowadays."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One can judge by these summaries how little
Kuprin "pads" his stories. Most of them are
reduced to a commonplace anecdote, which the
author is careful not to ornament in the least.
He respects truth to such a degree that he
offers it to his readers in its disconcerting bareness.
He would think that he was failing in
his duty as an observer if he disguised it by
any literary mechanism.</p>

<p>His work, stripped of all general ideas and
of all subjective aspects, is of a rather curious
impersonality. Nothing ever betrays his intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
thoughts or feelings. And it is in this
respect that he differs so much from most of
the writers of to-day, who give themselves up
completely to their attractive heroes and vituperate
their odious people. Kuprin's objective
tendencies are best shown in his story called
"Peaceful Life."</p>

<p>A retired official, Nassedkine, who has been
enriched by the gratuities which he has exacted
from those who have had to do business with
him, has made it his duty to play censor in his
little town. He makes use of a very discreet
and edifying method: to all of the citizens
whose honor is in danger, he sends one or more
anonymous letters telling them of the "extent
of their misfortune."</p>

<p>Nassedkine has just finished writing two
laconic notes, one of which is to a young
woman whom he tells to visit one of her friends
on a certain day, when, he assures her, her husband
is always to be found there. At this moment
the church bells ring, and Nassedkine, who
is religious, goes to vespers. On entering, he
notices a fashionable lady, all dressed in black,
in a dark corner of the church. Nassedkine,
more than any one else, knows the heart-rending
story of this woman. She had recently, against
her will, married an excessively rich wood merchant
who was almost forty years older than
she. One day, when she thought that her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
had gone off on business, he returned unexpectedly
and found her in the arms of one
of his employees. He had been warned that
same morning, by an anonymous letter, that
his wife was deceiving him.</p>

<p>"Beside himself with rage, the merchant
threw his employee out of the house, and then
satiated his brutal jealousy on his wife. He
struck her with his big, hobnailed boots; then
he called his coachman and valet, made her undress
completely, and had each of them in turn
lash her beautiful body until, covered with
blood, she fainted away.</p>

<p>"And as the priest at the altar was reciting:
'Lord, I offer Thee the tears of a woman who
has sinned,' Nassedkine repeated this phrase
with satisfaction. Then he left the church in
order to post the two letters he had just written."</p>

<p>This characteristic dryness does not come, as
one is liable to think, from ill-disguised insensibility.
Kuprin's soul, on the contrary, is of
such exquisitely fine texture that all human
emotions vibrate there. The few times when he
has expressed himself are enough to convince
the reader. He has often pitied women with a
discreet, fraternal compassion. He has also
devoted many pages to the sufferings of animals,
be it the story of circus horses hurt by
the rolling of the ship, or the story of a kitten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
mutilated by wolves. Only a few words are
needed to make us tender and to bring tears to
our eyes. And it is with the eyes of a poet or
a child that he has viewed nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No one ever studies a Russian author without
finally asking himself what the author's influence
was on the political manifestations of
society. The answer here is not hard to find:
Kuprin, observer, artist, and painter of life,
has had no influence. If we except one story,
"The Toast," in which he shows his deep affection
for the oppressed classes, nothing in
his work betrays even slightly his opinions on
this subject. Always, the thought of Kuprin
deserts the social struggle to fly into more vast
and serene surroundings than the theatre of
wars and revolutions. And he is doubtless
ready to exalt above this terrible struggle, the
one thing that he judges eternal, the love of
woman.</p>

<p>"There have been kingdoms and kings," he
says in his beautiful novel, "Sulamite," "and
the only trace that is left of them is the wind
in the desert. There have been long and pitiless
wars, at the end of which the names of the
leaders sparkled like stars: time has effaced all
memory of them.</p>

<p>"But the love of a poor girl of the vineyards
and a great king<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> will never be effaced and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
will always live in the minds of men, because
love is divinely beautiful, because every woman
who loves is a queen, because love is stronger
than death."</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br />
WRITERS IN VOGUE</h2>


<p>As we have already noted in the first chapter
of this book, Russian literature from 1830 to
1905 is distinctly different from European
literature: it is, above all, a literature of action
and social propagandas which puts the popular
cause in the place of prominence.</p>

<p>This cause has been abandoned by several
writers during the last few years. From 1905
to 1910, an evolution, accelerated by the most
audacious hopes and the most lively beliefs, has
transformed the story and the novel, and has
brought to the front certain authors who, up
to this time, had scarcely been known. It seems
as if suddenly the ancient tradition of Russian
literature had been broken. Contrary to the
rule of their predecessors, whose thoughts were
on justice and liberty, and whose works breathe
forth a wholesome quality, a large number of
the present writers have been gradually attracted
by metaphysical questions, which fill
their works with a veritable chaos of morbid
conceptions and disenchantment. Some express
with acuteness man's unconquerable fear of life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
or death; others treat of the divine or satanic
principles in man; still others study, with a
sickly passion, the problems of the flesh in all
of its manifestations.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Among the latter, Michael Artzybashev is a
writer of great breadth, whose erotic tendencies
have spoiled some of his best traits. His novel,
"Sanine," which recently caused so much talk,
pretends to paint the youth of to-day in Russia.
If we believed the author, we should conclude
that the above-mentioned youth consisted
of hysterical people in whom chastity was the
least of virtues.</p>

<p>The heroes of his novel are two representatives
of the revolutionary youth, Sanine and
Yuri Svagorich. Both of them have deserted
"the cause," Sanine, through lassitude, and
Yuri, who has met nothing but a despairing
indifference among those whom he wanted to
save from "the oppression of the shadows,"
through scorn. Yuri, "a man of the past," is
an "intellectual" entirely impregnated with
generous altruism, haunted by social and political
preoccupations. But he is also a "failure"
who falls from one deception into another, because
he is thoroughly powerless to combat life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his friend, Vladimir
Sanine, "the man of the future," is, without
a doubt, capable of living. None is freer than
he from all social and political preoccupations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
and none is more than he resolved to obey only
his lucid egotism, or the suggestions of his instincts.</p>

<p>These two young fellows meet, one summer,
in the country. Yuri lives with his father, a
retired colonel; Sanine, with his mother.
Sanine's sister, Lida, is in love with the officer
Zaroudine, who abandons her later when she is
with child. Lida wants to commit suicide, but
Sanine stops her and proposes that she marry
Dr. Novikov, who has been in love with her for
a long time. Parallel to the history of Lida,
the life story of Karsavina is presented. Yuri
falls in love with this young and pretty school-teacher.
But, although she returns Yuri's love,
the young girl, in a moment of passion, gives
herself to Sanine, whom she does not love. Disgusted
with life, feeling himself weak, neurasthenic,
and sick, Yuri, only twenty-six years of
age, commits suicide. Karsavina, terribly affected
by this act of despair, leaves Sanine.
And the latter, after Yuri's funeral, disappears
from the city....</p>

<p>All the characters in the book, from Sanine
to Karsavina, are continually preyed upon by
carnal desires. Long passages of funereal
scenes alternate with pictures of the transports
of love and the descriptions of masculine and
feminine bodies. "Your body proclaims the
truth, your reason lies." This is the "leitmotiv"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of all the theories that the characters
in the book preach.</p>

<p>Let us hasten to add to the praise of the
Russian public, that the enormous success of
"Sanine" was not justified by the extreme
licentiousness of the book, but by the eloquence
with which the author claims the right of free
love for man and woman.</p>

<p>Although its success was less than that of
"Sanine," Artzybashev's second novel, "Morning
Shadows," is more interesting and is more
realistic than his first.</p>

<p>Tired of their sometimes happy, sometimes
monotonous existence, two young people from
the provinces, Lisa and Dora, go to St.&nbsp;Petersburg
to take some courses there and to join
the <a class="corr" name="TC_8" id="TC_8" title="revolutinary">revolutionary</a> movement. They have read
Nietzsche, and want to "live dangerously." In
order to realize this project, Lisa has not hesitated
to break off her engagement with the
charming and na&iuml;ve Lieutenant Savinov. However,
their existence in the capital is nothing
but a long and bitter deception: Dora's literary
ambitions disappointed! the love of Lisa, who
has given herself to the student Korenyev, disappointed!
In a fit of despair Lisa kills herself,
and her friend, who has not had the courage
to follow her example, falls victim to a
terrorist outrage which the author describes
with rare power.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>In his recent novel, "Before Expiration,"&mdash;which
recalls "Sanine" to our minds again,&mdash;Artzybashev
has found some ingenious variations
on the old theme, "love and death." The
story of the love affairs of the painter Mikhailov,
a cynical and brutal Lovelace who abandons
his mistresses when they are with child,
is intermingled incessantly with gloomy episodes,
such as the agonies of an old man or of
a child. It is a book for "blas&eacute;" people, a
book which a reader with moral health will
not read without a certain feeling of uneasiness.</p>

<p>We are also indebted to Artzybashev for a
series of highly colored stories. "Sub-Lieutenant
Golobov," "Blood," "The Workingman
Shevshrev," and "The Millions" are some of
the most remarkable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Like Artzybashev, but with less talent, Anatol
Kamensky has written little stories happily
enough conceived. Thus, "Laida"&mdash;the
story of a worldly woman so taken up with
liberty that she exhibits herself nude before
her husband's guests. Another story called
"Four," tells of four women taken from the
most diverse social classes, ranging from a
young school-girl to the wife of a clergyman,
who give themselves to an officer at the end of
a trip of twenty-four hours. Then there is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the story of a woman who proposes to an unknown
man that he should play a game of cards
with her companions, she being the prize. This
story is called "The Game." Finally, there is
the story of a young man whose agreeable profession
consists in living among others gratuitously
and in seducing women under the eyes of
their husbands.</p>

<p>These stories are sadly spoiled by a crude
philosophy and by "anarchistic" protestations
against present values.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Certain authors wander into far-away countries
for their subjects: to Sodom and Lesbos.
The best known is Michael Kouzmine. This
writer, who happily began with stories of the
Orient in the Middle Ages, has now acquired a
rather sad renown for himself with his story
called "The Wings," which appeared at the end
of 1906. The scandalous success which this
book won, encouraged the author to go on in
the same manner. In poor verse, and especially
in the story, "The Castle of Cards," Kouzmine
has exalted the sin of Sodom as being the most
supreme form of &aelig;sthetic emotions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Closely related to these writers, although
surpassing them all in original talent, Feodor
Sologoub is the most intellectual and subtle of
the Russian modernists. His principal work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
consists in depicting the small provincial towns.
His heroes are little bourgeois petty officials,
school-teachers, and country proprietors.</p>

<p>This chanter of birth and death, disgusted
by the banality of existence, has given us, under
the title, "The Little Demon," a pathetic
picture of human baseness and sordidness, which
cannot be read without emotion.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of an arbitrary regime engenders
almost always "demonomania." The
insecurity of life, and the consecutive injustices
in the cavils of the police administration, develop
in society a reciprocal fear and distrust. From
feeling themselves in danger of being denounced
and menaced in their liberty, men rapidly become
the prey of terror. And the terrible life,
sooner or later, awakens demoniacal terror
among the weak. But people of this sort are
legion in Russia, and Peredonov, the hero of
"The Little Demon," represents this class
so graphically that to-day Russian historians
and authors designate the era from 1880 to
1905 by the name "peredonovchina." The following
is a brief outline of the story:</p>

<p>Peredonov is a school-teacher in a provincial
town. His fondest dream is to be nominated
primary inspector. He lives with his mistress,
the old dressmaker, Varvara by name. One of
his mistress's clients, a virtuous and philanthropic
princess, makes him understand, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
day, that she will have him nominated if he marries
Varvara. Peredonov does not love his mistress;
he simply lives with her from habit and
because she bears, without complaining too
much, his coarseness, his cavilling, and his bad
humor. However, he will marry her if the
princess can get him the position he desires.
But will the princess keep her word? It is
some time since she has let herself be heard
from. What is to be done?</p>

<p>"Marry," says his friend Routilov to him,
when he is told the condition of things. "I
have three sisters," he continues. "Choose
the one you like best and marry her immediately.
Thus Varvara will know nothing and
cannot throw any obstacles in the way."</p>

<p>"Done!" cries Peredonov, who has known
the three sisters for a long time. He chooses
the youngest, Valerie.</p>

<p>"Go and tell her about it. I will wait for
you in the hall and then we'll go to the priest's
together."</p>

<p>Alone, Peredonov again muses: "Doubtless,
Valerie is pretty and I shall be happy to have
her as my wife. But she is young, pretentious;
she will demand lots of new clothes, she will
want to go out a lot, in fact, so much that I'll
not be able to lay anything aside. Moreover,
she'll not look after the kitchen, I'll have poor
food, and the cook will rob us." Anguish seizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
him. He knocks at the window, calls his friend,
and says:</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the other, horrified.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have reflected, and I have decided
that I prefer the second, Lyoudmila."</p>

<p>Lyoudmila consents, for, besides his personal
fortune, Peredonov occupies an enviable position,
and the sisters are poor. She hurriedly
gets dressed; in a quarter of an hour she will
be ready to accompany him to the priest's.</p>

<p>However, Peredonov reflects: "Lyoudmila is
pretty and plump; she doubtless has a perfect
body, but she is always jolly, she loves to laugh.
She will laugh incessantly and will make her
husband seem ridiculous." Full of fear, he
knocks at the window: "I have reflected," he
cries. "I prefer the oldest, Darya."</p>

<p>"What an awful man!" cries his friend.
"Hurry up, Darya, or he'll leave all of us in
the lurch."</p>

<p>Again Peredonov reflects: "Darya is nice,
not young any more, and economical; she knows
life. But ... she is decisive in her resolutions,
and she has an energetic character. She
is not the kind who would listen to my observations.
She could make life hard for me, and
use me ill. Frankly, do I have to marry any of
the three sisters? What will the princess say
when she hears of my marriage? And my position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
as inspector? How stupid it is to stand
waiting in this court! Without a doubt, Routilov
ensnared me. I've got to get out of this
at any cost!"</p>

<p>He spits on all sides to conjure up the spirits,
then knocks at the window, and tells the amazed
family:</p>

<p>"I am going away.... I have thought it
over. I don't want to get married."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his position in school becomes
intolerable; complaints are registered against
him; he is reproached with having ill-treated
and even with having beaten the poor children,
and with treating the noble and rich children
with too much respect. His ridiculous and evil
passions cause him to be detested by all.
Luckily, he will soon be nominated inspector,
and then he will say good-bye to all this riff-raff.
In the meantime, Varvara writes a letter,
filled with the most alluring promises, to which
she signs the princess's name, and has it mailed
from St.&nbsp;Petersburg. Peredonov is at the
height of joy; but, being a prudent man, he
does not want to marry before he has received
the nomination. He waits and waits for it, and,
meanwhile, he is not even sure of his position
in the school. He discovers enemies everywhere,
and believes there are always spies at his heels.
In order to cajole the administration, he begins
to frequent the church, and to pay visits to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
city authorities. He assures the chief of police
of his respect, and, in order to give a glaring
proof of his devotion to the established institutions,
he lodges information against a school-mistress
of the locality. But still the nomination
does not come, and he lives in a continual
trance. The evil in him increases. He torments
beasts and human beings. He whips his pupils,
throws nettles at his cat, and maltreats his cook.
He believes himself more and more in the
power of the demon, and terrible visions follow
him:</p>

<p>"He saw running before him, a little, grey,
noisy beast. It sneered, its head trembled, and
it ran quickly around Peredonov. When he
wanted to seize it, it escaped under the cupboard,
only to reappear a moment later...."</p>

<p>This strange book, written with rare perfection,
had a great success. To several readers
who thought that they recognized the author
himself in the person of Peredonov (Sologoub
had had the same position as his hero for several
years) the author replied in the preface of a
recent edition, by these malicious lines:</p>

<p>"Men like to be loved. They adore noble
and elevated descriptions and portrayals. They
even search among the scum for a 'divine
spark.' They also are surprised and offended
when any one offers them a veracious and sombre
picture. And most of them then do not fail to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
declare: 'The author has described himself in
his work.' But no, my dear friends and
readers, it is you, and only you, whom I have
painted in my book, 'The Little Demon.'"</p>

<p>In "The Charms of Navii" Sologoub happily
blends fantasy and reality. Revolutionary
meetings alternate with improbable hypnotic
seances, and terrible cort&egrave;ges of corpses contrast
violently with scenes of platonic and
ethereal love.</p>

<p>The plot of the story, "The Old Home," is
not less distressing than the preceding one. A
young revolutionary, condemned to death by
court-martial, has been executed, but for his
dear ones this death has never been a reality.
His mother and sister, and even the old servant,
have not the strength to admit his disappearance.
They wait and wait for his return until
their own death carries them off.</p>

<p>Another story, "The Crowd," shows us a
"fair" at which pewter goblets are being given
away. These so excite the greediness of the
crowd that a fray results, in which three children
are seriously wounded. While dying, the
unfortunates have terrible visions of life and
humanity. "It seemed to them that ferocious
demons were chuckling and sneering silently
behind human faces. And this masquerade
lasted so long that the poor little tots thought
that it would never end...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Sologoub is, above all, a chanter of death.
Almost all of his works unveil a murder, suicide,
or madness. Moreover, the author, who shows
only the injustices, evils, and infamy of life,
and who affirms that the only happiness that he
foresees for man is the possibility of "creating
for himself a chimera" by turning away from
reality, finds the clearest colors and the sweetest
expressions in speaking of death.</p>

<p>"There is not a surer and more tender friend
on earth than death," says one of his heroes.
"And if men fear the name of death, it is because
they do not know that it is the real life,
eternal and invariable. Life deceives very often,
death never. It is sweet to think of death, as
it is to think of a dear friend, distant and yet
always close at hand.... One forgets all in
the arms of the consoling angel, the angel of
death."</p>

<p>The ever supremely correct and beautiful
language of Sologoub shows the power of a
master, and it is most regrettable that an artist
of his merit should confine himself to so morbid
an art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These then are the principal authors&mdash;some
of whom have enjoyed an immense popularity&mdash;who
treat the "cursed questions:" the rights
of the flesh, the problem of death, and other
equally "cursed" problems.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>The other writers are principally occupied
with social questions, and, without rigorously
following in the steps of their predecessors, remain,
however, most of the time, realists.</p>

<p>Among these, Sergyev-Tzensky occupies a
prominent place. The stories of this writer
show us beings who seem strangers to what is
going on around them. This peculiarity comes
from the fact that Tzensky does not understand
the physical facts in the same way that the naturalists
do. For him, they are the manifestations
of the will of a supernatural entity, incomprehensible,
inconceivable, and, at the same time,
clearly hostile to man.</p>

<p>His story, "The Sadness of the Fields," testifies
to this singular conception. A farmer and
his wife, good and peaceful people, have for
many years wished for a child. Up to this
time, the six children which the mother has
given birth to have died in their infancy. They
are anxiously awaiting the seventh. Will this
one live? Will not the sadness of the fields,
which puts its imprint on everything, kill it as
it has killed the others? Alas! the child is not
viable, and the mother dies in child-birth. They
are buried, and "the fields and the surrounding
country forever keep their powerful and mysterious
melancholy."</p>

<p>"The Fluctuation" is one of the most curious
and beautiful of all of Tzensky's stories.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Anton Antonovich, a rich and enterprising merchant,
of a very violent and unruly character,
lives like a wolf in his domains, alone with his
family, without seeing any of his neighbors.
The peasants detest him. As his partners and
helpers, he always engages nonentities, without
power of initiative, who blindly follow his
orders. Intellectual and energetic men cannot
get along with him. Men, beasts, and nature
in its entirety, are considered by this man as
having been especially created for his service.
The one end of his life is wealth and power.
The only beings he loves are his wife and his
three sons; but even they have to bow down
to his will.</p>

<p>One day, he buys some straw and insures it
against fire. Sometime later, it burns. They
accuse him of having been the incendiary.
Ridiculous accusation! He is a millionaire and
the straw barely cost a few hundred rubles.
The old man makes fun of the whole affair; he
insults the judge, his own lawyer, and even the
jury. He feels the impending misfortune, but
his inborn violence carries him away from prudence.
He is condemned to hard labor and he
succumbs to a sickness that he has been feeling
coming on for a long time. He had made a
pillager's nest for himself, and he died like a
pillager, abandoned even by those who were
dear to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>In Tzensky's short stories, "I Shall Soon
Die," "Diphtheria," "Tedium," and "The
Masks," there is something mysterious, fatal,
and terrible that constantly surrounds his
people. As to his longer works, "The Swamp
in the Forest," and "Lieutenant Babayev,"
they plunge the reader into the mad chaos of
the often abnormal emotions felt by the characters.
These characters imagine the divine
side of human nature; they consider it as
having existed before in the essence of things,
but the reality does not harmonize with their
dream. The authentication of this discord
torments Tzensky's heroes and their souls protest
passionately, but in vain, against these
outrages.</p>

<p>Sergyev-Tzensky's style, graphic and pure,
often strange, has found imitators among the
younger writers. Thus, Mouyzhel, who describes
village life, is visibly influenced by his
writings. <a class="corr" name="TC_9" id="TC_9" title="Acording">According</a> to him, the soul goes
through life without understanding it, without
being able to ascribe any meaning to it. And
he is so sincere, that his works obtain the frankest
sort of success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Mouyzhel studies peasant life, Simon
Youshkevich, to the exclusion of all else, makes
a study of the poor Russian Jews. Some of
his stories have produced an overwhelming impression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
They show us beings, heaped up,
pell-mell in the ghettos of the cities of western
and southern Russia, dirty and unwholesome
ghettos, where consumption and all kinds
of terrible sickness reign. These stories, often
tragic, always sad, have given Youshkevich the
name of "chanter of human suffering."</p>

<p>In his earlier works&mdash;the best of which are
"The Jews," "Tavern-Keeper Heimann,"
"The Innocents," "The Prologue" and "The
Assassin"&mdash;he devoted himself to portraying,
not isolated persons, but the immense Russian
Jewish proletariat, with its sad past, its bloody
present, and its exalted faith in the future.
Youshkevich has created this sphere; he considers
the poor people of the cities not as a
social class, but as a symbolic representation of
an entire organization. If his work is at times
infected with romanticism and some exaggeration
the reader will gladly forget these imperfections
when he recognizes the fact that they
are necessary to enable this author to express
the truth. What makes this writer unique, is
that he cannot be confounded with any one else.
He has never influenced any of his readers and,
in turn, has never imitated any one. He made
himself what he is.</p>

<p>His last literary productions&mdash;with the exception
of his very touching drama, "Misere"&mdash;have
been inferior to his former work. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the abundance of the materials furnished by
Jewish life would still give this author opportunity
to give us more of the magnificently
colored pictures that he gave us in his initial
productions.</p>

<p>Close to Youshkevich should be placed the
two young writers, Sholom Ash and Izemann.
Sholom Ash has principally depicted the Jewish
world and its psychology. "The God of Vengeance"
is a touching picture of the life of
young Jewish girls who have been obliged to
prostitute themselves for a living. "Sabbatai-Zevi,"<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
a philosophical poem, treats of the
powerful personality of that Jewish prophet and
of the surroundings in which he passed his
life.</p>

<p>Izemann, who has written quite a few tales
and stories, is a very uneven author. His best
work is "The Thorn Bush," a drama of the
life of the Russian-Jewish revolutionists.
Manousse, the son of a poor tinsmith, has
been arrested, and then hanged for having taken
part in a terrorist uprising. His sister, Dara,
engaged to the son of a wealthy manufacturer,
has, in her turn, been killed at a barricade. She
is carried back to her home, and there, revolver
in hand, the mother receives the soldiers. She
falls mortally wounded at the side of her
fourteen year old son. Thus, the entire
family perishes. The last act of this sombre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
drama makes a tremendous impression on the
stage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After having been a country doctor for several
years, Eugene Chirikov abandoned his practice
in order to devote himself to literature.
His drama, "The Jews," has aroused great interest
and has been played with great success
both in Russia and abroad. It is one of the
most significant works of this writer. The story
concerns itself with the children of a poor Jewish
watchmaker, who are infatuated with ideas
of progress. Their infatuation is such, that
the daughter becomes engaged to a Gentile.
A delirious mob invades the houses of the Jews.
The store of the poor watchmaker is not spared,
and the fianc&eacute;e of the Gentile is ravished and
then murdered. The rapid action of the play
makes it a dramatic "slice of life."</p>

<p>The other plays and stories of this author
give us pictures both of the petty "bourgeois"
and of the "intellectuals." Thus, "The
Strangers" tells the story of a group of "intellectuals"
who have strayed into a small market
town in the provinces where all are hostile
to them. Then there is "The Invalids," which
gives the story of the life of an old man who,
after having been exiled to Siberia for several
years on account of "advanced" ideas, returns
to Russia as confident as ever, ready to consecrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the rest of his life to the people. Finally,
"At the Bottom of the Court," "The Mysteries
of the Forest" and "Marya Ivanovna" are
dramas from bourgeois life, while "The
Sorceress" is a play, taken from a national
epic.</p>

<p>Not less well known than Chirikov, is Ossip
Dymov. He forsook the "Imperial Institute
of Foresters" in order to devote himself to
literature. He has written numerous stories,
among which "Vlass" is the most captivating.
It is the childhood of Vlass told by himself. An
observing little person, the child notices everything
and everybody around him. His father
had killed himself before the child was old
enough to talk, and his mother, a very intelligent
and stern woman, alone had to care for
four children. Vlass has an older brother, Yuri,
a sister, Olya, and a younger brother, Vladimir,
a kind and inoffensive creature. Life runs
along smoothly in the little country town. The
days pass, one like the other, and the most insignificant
event takes on grave importance in
this monotonous life. One night, Vlass's young
teacher is arrested and sent to Siberia. A year
later, a friend of the family, who has been in
exile a long time, comes back secretly and passes
several days at the house. Later on, it is "the
beautiful, good aunt" who comes unexpectedly;
but she soon departs, leaving a mass of confused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and restless thoughts in the child's mind. Vlass
ends his story with a most pathetic account.
Far away from the little town, in one of the
prisons of St.&nbsp;Petersburg, they are going to
hang Yuri. The entire family has broken down
since they have heard the news, and they sit up
the night before the execution, trying, in
thought, to alleviate the torment of their cherished
one.</p>

<p>In his other stories, the author paints nature
in an original and entirely personal manner.
According to a Russian critic, the works of
Dymov breathe forth "the fresh breeze and the
quickening aroma of the forests."</p>

<p>Dymov has also written some very well-liked
plays, of which "Niyu" is the most original.
Niyu, a young woman, abandons her husband
and child in order to follow a poet, whose beautiful
language and touching poetry have won
her admiration and brought her under his spell.
She hopes that her lover will create a new world,
a higher and nobler world than the every-day
one, because he is a poet, that is to say, one of
the elect. The abandoned husband and the uncared-for
child desperately call out for their
wife and mother. In vain! However, the days
that she passes with the poet are filled with disenchantment,
disillusion, and bitterness. Despairing,
she writes a letter to her old parents
who live in a distant town, and then commits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
suicide. And hardly is Niyu buried, when the
poet, although sadly affected by the premature
loss of his companion, again begins to charm
and entrance by his beautiful words other
women, whose lives he ruins.</p>

<p>"Niyu" has had a tremendous success, because
it brings a really new formula into
the theatrical world. Very little action, very
few "situations;" no artificial procedure: life;
dialogue imitated from reality; an atmosphere
of despair and tedium in which three
beings cruelly struggle; sincere evolution, very
much pessimism, and happiness and love, constitute
the traits that characterize this very
human piece of writing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mention should also be made of Sayitzev, certain
of whose stories are comparable to the
aquarelles of a landscape painter. One of his
best works is "Agrafena," a touching picture
of the life of a peasant woman. During her
lifetime, she was a domestic in the cities, and
when finally, bent under years of labor, she
comes back to her native village and her
daughter, whom she has secretly brought up at
great pains, it is only to find that she has committed
suicide, having been abandoned by her
lover.</p>

<p>Among others, should be mentioned Gussev-Orenburgsky,
who has written some very interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
stories about the Russian clergy; Skitaletz,
whose "Rural Tribunal" has had a great
success, and has been translated into several
languages; Seraphimovich and Teleshov, who,
like Chirikov, depict the life of the "intellectuals,"
and Olizhey, the psychologist of revolutionary
spheres, known particularly by his
"The Day of Judgment," which tells of an
officer, a member of a council of war, who is
forced to condemn his future brother-in-law to
death. This story leaves an indescribable impression
of terror and horror.</p>

<p>Let us finally mention Count Alexis Tolstoy,
the homonym of the great Russian thinker, to
whom the critics predict a brilliant future. His
first work appeared in 1909. He generally depicts
landed proprietors. His recent stories,
"The Asking in Marriage," and "Beyond the
Volga," show signs of great strength and power
of observation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the women, there are three who show
real talent. In fact, Mme. Hippius-Merezhkovskaya
is regarded as one of the founders of
Russian modernism. We are indebted to her
for some rather daring verses and some very
good stories. The most recent of these, "The
Creature," is the curious history of a love-sick
prostitute; "The Devil's Doll" is an episode in
the life of the Russian "intellectuals." Endowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
with a caustic spirit, she excels all others
in literary criticism.</p>

<p>Then comes Mme. Verbitzkaya, who has declared
herself a champion of women, who, she
thinks, should throw off the often tyrannical
yoke of their husbands. Her novels, "Vavochka,"
and "The Story of a Life," have
given her just renown. In "The Spirit of the
Time" she has tried, not without some success,
to paint the immense picture of the revolution
of 1905. Her recent novel, "The Keys
of Happiness," has had an enormous success.</p>

<p>Finally, mention should be made of Mme.
Shepkina-Koupernik, who has written some
verses and charming stories, full of caressing
tenderness and delicate psychology. Her
stories, in which she shows us two old Italian
masters, are very interesting. Thus, "Eternity
in a Moment" is delicious. In a painter's
studio, a young model by chance meets her old
lover, who has also been reduced to posing in
studios. Happy at heart, the woman rushes
toward him, but he pushes her away: he is too
miserable, he has fallen too low to dare to love
her again. Repulsed by him, she stands as if
petrified, with death in her soul, and her face
changed by terrible despair. At this moment
the master enters; he looks at the young
woman and utters a cry of joy; finally he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
found what he wants for his picture: human
traits ravaged by suffering and despair!</p>

<p>Russia is also indebted to this author for
impeccable translations of Rostand's "Princesse
Lointaine" and "Chantecler."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> For some reason, unknown to the translator,
the author has made no mention of Tchekoff's
famous play, "The Sea-Gull." This drama,
which, when first produced, was a flat failure,
scored a tremendous success a short while afterwards.
It is especially interesting in that the
author has made one of the characters, Trigorin,
largely autobiographical. To-day "The Sea-Gull"
is one of the most popular productions
on the Russian stage.</p></div>

has become synonymous with servility and
moral baseness. Merezhkovsky employs this
scornful term to designate those people who are
strangers to the higher tendencies of the mind
and are entirely taken up with material interests.
His "Ham Triumphant" is the Antichrist,
whose reign, as predicted by the Apocalypse,
will begin with the final victory of the
bourgeoisie. In one chapter of this book,
Merezhkovsky proves that the writers of western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Europe and Russia (Byron and Lermontov)
err in crowning this Antichrist with
an aureole of proud revolutionary majesty, for,
since he is the enemy of all that is divine in
man, he can only be a character of shabby
mediocrity and human banality, that is to say,
a veritable "Ham."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Merezhkovsky has also written a long historical
drama, called "The Death of Paul I."
He traces there, with his accustomed animation,
the figure of the weak and criminal Tsar, now
heaping favors upon those who surround him,
now persecuting them with the most terrible
cruelty. The savage scene of the assassination
of this tyrant is of remarkable beauty.</p></div>

been ephemeral. Since the beginning of 1910,
according to a Russian critic, "the salubrity
of the atmosphere" has been accomplished.
The "cursed questions" are less prominent in
recent works, and it seems that the crisis which
desolated Russian literature for several years
has come to an end, and that the writers are
going back to the old traditions of Russian literature.</p></div>
